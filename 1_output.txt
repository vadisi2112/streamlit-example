The number of active validators on the proof-of-stake network of Ethereum declined considerably after the Shapella upgrade was implemented on 12 April.

Since Ethereum’s [ETH] Shapella upgrade went live on 12 April, there has been a steep decline in active validator count on the proof-of-stake (POS) network, data from Glassnode revealed.

Information obtained from the on-chain data provider put the active validator count on the network at 562,941 on 12 April.

Just 24 hours after the Shanghai upgrade went live, this fell to 561,655, where it has since remained.

Observed on a 30-day moving average, the total number of validators that voluntarily exited Ethereum’s validator pool since Shapella rose significantly by over 400%.

The continued decline in active validator count on the Ethereum POS network is due to a rally in the withdrawals of previously deposited ETH coins by some validators on the network.

Following the Shapella upgrade, validators that had previously secured the network with more than 18 million ETH were free to initiate withdrawals, which some of them did.

According to a Nansen dashboard, 10,675 validators were scheduled for full exit in the last hour at press time.

Many expected ETH’s value to dip significantly once Shapella went live due to increased withdrawals and sell-offs to make a profit by those who had initially staked their ETH coins.

In contrast, the alt’s value rose momentarily after the upgrade.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, ETH’s price jumped by 14% between 12 and 16 April.

As of 16 April, the leading altcoin traded above $2000, after which the price descent began.

Exchanging hands at $1,897.75 at press time, ETH’s price has since decreased by 11%.

Despite the price fall, ETH whales that hold between 100,000 to 10,000,000 ETH coins have intensified accumulation.

Per data from Santiment, since the Shapella, the count of these big whales increased by 2.5%.

Conversely, whales that hold between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH coins have taken a risk-averse approach and dumped some of their ETH holdings.

Data from Santiment revealed that their number has gone down by 1% since Shapella.

Further, while the ephemeral jump in ETH’s value following the Shapella upgrade caused market sentiment to turn positive on 14 April, the price decline caused the alt’s weighted sentiment to return to negative territory, where it has since remained.

At press time, this was -1.172.

With persistent negative sentiment lingering in the market, any significant spike in ETH’s price might be hard to come by.

Ethereum Ethereum [ETH]: Dipping prices, rising negative sentiments and everything in between 2min Read The number of active validators on the proof-of-stake network of Ethereum declined considerably after the Shapella upgrade was implemented on 12 April.

ETH’s value has since posted a double-digit decline.

Since Ethereum’s [ETH] Shapella upgrade went live on 12 April, there has been a steep decline in active validator count on the proof-of-stake (POS) network, data from Glassnode revealed.

Source: Glassnode Read Ethereum’s Price Prediction 2023-2024 Information obtained from the on-chain data provider put the active validator count on the network at 562,941 on 12 April.

Just 24 hours after the Shanghai upgrade went live, this fell to 561,655, where it has since remained.

Observed on a 30-day moving average, the total number of validators that voluntarily exited Ethereum’s validator pool since Shapella rose significantly by over 400%.

Source: Glassnode The continued decline in active validator count on the Ethereum POS network is due to a rally in the withdrawals of previously deposited ETH coins by some validators on the network.

Following the Shapella upgrade, validators that had previously secured the network with more than 18 million ETH were free to initiate withdrawals, which some of them did.

According to a Nansen dashboard, 10,675 validators were scheduled for full exit in the last hour at press time.

ETH prices take a plunge Many expected ETH’s value to dip significantly once Shapella went live due to increased withdrawals and sell-offs to make a profit by those who had initially staked their ETH coins.

In contrast, the alt’s value rose momentarily after the upgrade.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, ETH’s price jumped by 14% between 12 and 16 April.

As of 16 April, the leading altcoin traded above $2000, after which the price descent began.

Exchanging hands at $1,897.75 at press time, ETH’s price has since decreased by 11%.

Source: CoinMarketCap Despite the price fall, ETH whales that hold between 100,000 to 10,000,000 ETH coins have intensified accumulation.

Per data from Santiment, since the Shapella, the count of these big whales increased by 2.5%.

Conversely, whales that hold between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH coins have taken a risk-averse approach and dumped some of their ETH holdings.

Data from Santiment revealed that their number has gone down by 1% since Shapella.

Source: Santiment Realistic or not, here’s ETH’s market cap in BTC terms Further, while the ephemeral jump in ETH’s value following the Shapella upgrade caused market sentiment to turn positive on 14 April, the price decline caused the alt’s weighted sentiment to return to negative territory, where it has since remained.

At press time, this was -1.172.

With persistent negative sentiment lingering in the market, any significant spike in ETH’s price might be hard to come by.

Solana’s overall activity surged over the last 24 hours.

The protocol also witnessed improvements in the DeFi space as stablecoin growth increases.

Solana [SOL], despite facing criticisms for multiple downtimes on its network, has remained undeterred as it continued to make progress in terms of improving on its technology.

Is your portfolio green?

Due to this and various other factors, the overall activity on Solana started to surge.

According to data provided by Step Data Insights, in the past 24 hours, there has been a significant increase of 150,000 in the daily active addresses on Solana.

This development was in contrast to the downtrend observed on Polygon and Ethereum during the same period and reinforces the 30-day uptrend in Solana’s activity.

Solana was also observed to be doing well in the DeFi space as well.

Artemis’ data indicated that there was a huge surge in terms of stablecoin growth on Solana.

The Solana protocol managed to eclipse major competitors in the crypto space in this regard.

Additionally, the overall DEX volume on Solana also increased.

This was due to the interest gained by popular DEX’s on the Solana protocol such as Saber.

Dapp Radar’s data revealed that over the past week, Saber gained 61.14% unique active wallets on its platform.

Because of the positive performance of the DEX’s on the Solana network, its TVL also witnessed a massive uptick.

Stakers also showed their optimism in the Solana network during this period.

According to recent data provided by Staking Rewards, the number of addresses staking Solana increased by 2.99% over the last week.

At press time, the cumulative number of stakers on the Solana network was 608,394.

However, the same enthusiasm wasn’t shown by addresses in terms of buying SOL.

Since 17 April, the price of Solana fell by 16.08% after testing the $26.03 resistance.

Solana’s price later traded between the $24.05 and $20.77 levels, with the majority of the volume occurring at the $22.24 price point as showcased by the point of control line (red).

This line could act as a resistance to Solana’s price in the future.

Its Relative Stregnth Index (RSI) was at 48.40, and was slowly climbing up suggesting that Solana, may be slightly underbought at press time.

The last seven days were pretty eventful for Polygon, as pointed out by its co-founder.

However, MATIC did not respond positively.

Polygon [MATIC] has been registering a decline in fees and revenue over the last seven days.

In addition, Artemis’ chart pointed out that Polygon’s daily active addresses also went down last month.

However, Polygon’s co-founder Sandeep Nailwal, in a tweet posted on 4 May, gave hope for a trend reversal.

The tweet revealed several developments that happened in the Polygon ecosystem, which could show their impact in the coming days.

The most notable development was Google’s announcement of its support for Polygon Supernets (appchains).

The tech giant said it will support startups on Polygon in a joint fund with the network.

This can lead to a spike in the development of the Polygon network, which in turn can help the network grow.

Google Cloud will help accelerate adoption of core Polygon protocols w/ enterprise infrastructure & tools.

The blockchain’s DeFi space also got a boost as Franklin Templeton plans to tokenize large scale regulated financial products for Polygon.

This move can aid in increasing Polygon’s TVL, which has been stagnant for several months.

Apart from the aforementioned developments, Sotheby’s launched its NFT marketplace on the blockchain.

The new launch might provide support for Polygon’s dwindling NFT metrics.

As per Santiment, the blockchain’s NFT trade count and trade volume in USD declined sharply last week.

Additionally, CRYPTOSLAM’s data suggested that NFT sales volume also declined marginally in the past seven days.

Not only NFTs, but the blockchain also registered a decline in the number of stakers, as evident from Staking Rewards’ chart.

However, Blockdaemon extended support for Polygon staking, which too can show its effect in the coming days.

Big news!

We're thrilled to announce that #Blockdaemon now supports @0xPolygon with our cutting-edge Staking API!

This integration further expands our commitment to make staking seamless across multiple protocols.

MATIC‘s performance on the price front remained dormant throughout the last week, despite the big announcements.

According to CoinMarketCap, MATIC’s price declined by over 1.4% in the last seven days.

At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at $0.9888 with a market capitalization of more than $9.1 billion.

A look at MATIC’s on-chain performance gives an idea of what went wrong.

As per CryptoQuant, MATIC’s exchange reserve was increasing, which is bearish, as it indicated that the token was under selling pressure.

The total number of coins transferred has also decreased by 86.12% compared to the day before.

In addition to that, MATIC’s open interest increased in the last few days.

If open interest is on the rise, it signals that the market trends around that option are likely to continue, which increases the chances of a continued downtrend.

At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at $0.9888 with a market capitalization of more than $9.1 billion.

Realistic or not, here’s MATIC’s market cap in BTC terms As per CryptoQuant, MATIC’s exchange reserve was increasing, which is bearish, as it indicated that the token was under selling pressure.

The total number of coins transferred has also decreased by 86.12% compared to the day before.

In addition to that, MATIC’s open interest increased in the last few days.

If open interest is on the rise, it signals that the market trends around that option are likely to continue, which increases the chances of a continued downtrend.

polygon 💜 (@sandeepnailwal) May 3, 2023 Quite an eventful week for Polygon The most notable development was Google’s announcement of its support for Polygon Supernets (appchains).

The tech giant said it will support startups on Polygon in a joint fund with the network.

This can lead to a spike in the development of the Polygon network, which in turn can help the network grow.

Apart from the aforementioned developments, Sotheby’s launched its NFT marketplace on the blockchain.

The new launch might provide support for Polygon’s dwindling NFT metrics.

As per Santiment, the blockchain’s NFT trade count and trade volume in USD declined sharply last week.

Additionally, CRYPTOSLAM’s data suggested that NFT sales volume also declined marginally in the past seven days.

This integration further expands our commitment to make staking seamless across multiple protocols.

Blockdaemon 😈 (@BlockdaemonHQ) May 4, 2023 MATIC’s state is dire MATIC‘s performance on the price front remained dormant throughout the last week, despite the big announcements.

According to CoinMarketCap, MATIC’s price declined by over 1.4% in the last seven days.

At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at $0.9888 with a market capitalization of more than $9.1 billion.

Realistic or not, here’s MATIC’s market cap in BTC terms As per CryptoQuant, MATIC’s exchange reserve was increasing, which is bearish, as it indicated that the token was under selling pressure.

The total number of coins transferred has also decreased by 86.12% compared to the day before.

In addition to that, MATIC’s open interest increased in the last few days.

If open interest is on the rise, it signals that the market trends around that option are likely to continue, which increases the chances of a continued downtrend.

Bitcoin shows signs of positivity as MVRV ratio reaches new highs.

But traders remain skeptical of Bitcoin’s growth.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] rising prices have led to massive amounts of speculation amongst the crypto community.

Although some traders are skeptical about the increasing BTC prices, some data suggests there’s more positivity on the way.

According to Delphi Digital, the 75% spike Bitcoin witnessed over the last few months could indicate that the global markets are entering into a new liquidity cycle.

A new global liquidity cycle refers to a period where there is a significant increase in the availability of money and credit in the global financial system.

This can be due to factors such as central bank policies, government stimulus programs, and increased investor confidence.

If the market enters a new global liquidity cycle, it could potentially have a positive impact on the value of BTC.

This is because increased liquidity and credit availability can lead to higher investment activity and asset prices, which could drive demand for BTC.

Another positive indicator for BTC would be its MVRV ratio.

According to data provided by CryptoQuant, there is a likelihood that BTC could enter another bull run.

In January 2023, the MVRV ratio for Bitcoin broke the 1.5 level, indicating the start of a bull market.

The MVRV ratio was fluctuating between 1.55 and 1.45 at press time, with large investors monitoring it closely to buy discounted Bitcoins during dips.

The analysis also showed that the 365DSMA should be taken into consideration as well, with the MVRV ratio breaking it to signal a trend change.

If Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio breaks the 1.5 level again, it’s likely to shift to a range of values between 1.8 and 2, that is if BTC price reaches 30K.

Is your portfolio green?

Despite all these bullish signs, traders continued to remain cynical about BTC’s growth.

Based on data from TheBlock, the Put to Call ratio for Bitcoin has experienced a significant increase over recent months.

This suggested that a large number of traders have taken positions betting on a potential future decrease in BTC’s market price.

Despite Bitcoin showing bullish signs, traders continue to remain bearish against BTC.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] rising prices have led to massive amounts of speculation amongst the crypto community.

Although some traders are skeptical about the increasing BTC prices, some data suggests there’s more positivity on the way.

Read Bitcoin’s Price Prediction 2023-2024 According to Delphi Digital, the 75% spike Bitcoin witnessed over the last few months could indicate that the global markets are entering into a new liquidity cycle.

A new global liquidity cycle refers to a period where there is a significant increase in the availability of money and credit in the global financial system.

This can be due to factors such as central bank policies, government stimulus programs, and increased investor confidence.

If the market enters a new global liquidity cycle, it could potentially have a positive impact on the value of BTC.

This is because increased liquidity and credit availability can lead to higher investment activity and asset prices, which could drive demand for BTC.

Source: Delphi Digital Taking things positively Another positive indicator for BTC would be its MVRV ratio.

According to data provided by CryptoQuant, there is a likelihood that BTC could enter another bull run.

In January 2023, the MVRV ratio for Bitcoin broke the 1.5 level, indicating the start of a bull market.

The MVRV ratio was fluctuating between 1.55 and 1.45 at press time, with large investors monitoring it closely to buy discounted Bitcoins during dips.

The analysis also showed that the 365DSMA should be taken into consideration as well, with the MVRV ratio breaking it to signal a trend change.

If Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio breaks the 1.5 level again, it’s likely to shift to a range of values between 1.8 and 2, that is if BTC price reaches 30K.

According to data provided by CryptoQuant, there is a likelihood that BTC could enter another bull run.

In January 2023, the MVRV ratio for Bitcoin broke the 1.5 level, indicating the start of a bull market.

The MVRV ratio was fluctuating between 1.55 and 1.45 at press time, with large investors monitoring it closely to buy discounted Bitcoins during dips.

The analysis also showed that the 365DSMA should be taken into consideration as well, with the MVRV ratio breaking it to signal a trend change.

If Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio breaks the 1.5 level again, it’s likely to shift to a range of values between 1.8 and 2, that is if BTC price reaches 30K.

Despite Bitcoin showing bullish signs, traders continue to remain bearish against BTC.

Bitcoin’s [BTC] rising prices have led to massive amounts of speculation amongst the crypto community.

Although some traders are skeptical about the increasing BTC prices, some data suggests there’s more positivity on the way.

Read Bitcoin’s Price Prediction 2023-2024 According to Delphi Digital, the 75% spike Bitcoin witnessed over the last few months could indicate that the global markets are entering into a new liquidity cycle.

A new global liquidity cycle refers to a period where there is a significant increase in the availability of money and credit in the global financial system.

This can be due to factors such as central bank policies, government stimulus programs, and increased investor confidence.

A popular crypto strategist is updating his outlook on Bitcoin (BTC) and one Ethereum (ETH) rival as he warns memecoins are likely to collapse.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 195,100 Twitter followers that Bitcoin continues to lack a clear upward or downward trend and remains trading sideways.

According to his chart, Sherpa says Bitcoin has been chopping around in the $25,000 to $30,000 range for the past 48 days.

The previous range Bitcoin chopped around in was between about $19,500 and $25,000 and that lasted 57 days.

The problem for most traders the last six months is that there hasn’t been a continuous trending environment like in 2020 and 2021 (for alts).

Lots of chop overall and just a few trending weeks followed by more chop.

Bitcoin is trading for $29,305 at time of writing, up 1.5% during the past 24 hours.

Also on the trader’s radar is the new layer-1 blockchain Sui Network (SUI).

Based on Fibonacci retracement levels, a method of technical analysis for determining an asset’s support and resistance levels, Sherpa believes SUI will revisit a lower range of $1.29.

However, he warns if Bitcoin dips, SUI could drop down to $1.24.

Expecting range lows to come eventually around $1.29, but it’s going way lower if Bitcoin shits the bed IMO (In my opinion).

Sui Network is worth $1.31 at time of writing, down 1.9% during the past 24 hours.

Next, the trader weighs in on skyrocketing Pepe (PEPE), a memecoin that launched last month.

He warns Pepe and other meme tokens are likely going to collapse.

But be warned; these are all going to go to $0 and will be short lived.

Lastly, Altcoin Sherpa looks at layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB).

He predicts Aribitrum will dip lower by looking at several Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) and the Fibonacci retracement levels.

Traders look at the EMA to determine whether an asset’s price is in a downtrend.

If the price is below the EMA, then the asset is likely going to remain bearish.

Haven’t paid as much attention to this one lately, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it falls through and goes to the $1.15-$1.20 area again.

Arbitrum is worth $1.36 at time of writing, up 3% during the past 24 hours.

Top Trader Updates Outlook on Bitcoin and One New Ethereum Rival, Says This Crypto Asset Class Is Going to Zero by Daily Hodl Staff May 5, 2023 in Altcoins, Bitcoin, Ethereum A popular crypto strategist is updating his outlook on Bitcoin (BTC) and one Ethereum (ETH) rival as he warns memecoins are likely to collapse.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 195,100 Twitter followers that Bitcoin continues to lack a clear upward or downward trend and remains trading sideways.

According to his chart, Sherpa says Bitcoin has been chopping around in the $25,000 to $30,000 range for the past 48 days.

The previous range Bitcoin chopped around in was between about $19,500 and $25,000 and that lasted 57 days.

BTC: The problem for most traders the last six months is that there hasn’t been a continuous trending environment like in 2020 and 2021 (for alts).

Lots of chop overall and just a few trending weeks followed by more chop.

Know yourself and where to trade.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/Twitter Bitcoin is trading for $29,305 at time of writing, up 1.5% during the past 24 hours.

Also on the trader’s radar is the new layer-1 blockchain Sui Network (SUI).

Based on Fibonacci retracement levels, a method of technical analysis for determining an asset’s support and resistance levels, Sherpa believes SUI will revisit a lower range of $1.29.

However, he warns if Bitcoin dips, SUI could drop down to $1.24.

SUI: Expecting range lows to come eventually around $1.29, but it’s going way lower if Bitcoin shits the bed IMO (In my opinion).

Still, it looks like somewhat accumulation phase as long as BTC is stable.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/Twitter Sui Network is worth $1.31 at time of writing, down 1.9% during the past 24 hours.

Next, the trader weighs in on skyrocketing Pepe (PEPE), a memecoin that launched last month.

He warns Pepe and other meme tokens are likely going to collapse.

PEPE derivatives are going to moon, aka all the other memecoins right now.

But be warned; these are all going to go to $0 and will be short lived.

Full on casino over the next few weeks IMO (in my opinion), same story as it always is.” Lastly, Altcoin Sherpa looks at layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB).

He predicts Aribitrum will dip lower by looking at several Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) and the Fibonacci retracement levels.

Traders look at the EMA to determine whether an asset’s price is in a downtrend.

If the price is below the EMA, then the asset is likely going to remain bearish.

ARB: Haven’t paid as much attention to this one lately, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it falls through and goes to the $1.15-$1.20 area again.

This is still a great chain but new flavor of the month (SUI) + memecoin madness (PEPE) are sucking liquidity out of ‘normal’ coins.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/Twitter Arbitrum is worth $1.36 at time of writing, up 3% during the past 24 hours.

Top Trader Updates Outlook on Bitcoin and One New Ethereum Rival, Says This Crypto Asset Class Is Going to Zero by Daily Hodl Staff May 5, 2023 in Altcoins, Bitcoin, Ethereum A popular crypto strategist is updating his outlook on Bitcoin (BTC) and one Ethereum (ETH) rival as he warns memecoins are likely to collapse.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 195,100 Twitter followers that Bitcoin continues to lack a clear upward or downward trend and remains trading sideways.

According to his chart, Sherpa says Bitcoin has been chopping around in the $25,000 to $30,000 range for the past 48 days.

The previous range Bitcoin chopped around in was between about $19,500 and $25,000 and that lasted 57 days.

BTC: The problem for most traders the last six months is that there hasn’t been a continuous trending environment like in 2020 and 2021 (for alts).

Lots of chop overall and just a few trending weeks followed by more chop.

Know yourself and where to trade.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/Twitter Bitcoin is trading for $29,305 at time of writing, up 1.5% during the past 24 hours.

Also on the trader’s radar is the new layer-1 blockchain Sui Network (SUI).

Based on Fibonacci retracement levels, a method of technical analysis for determining an asset’s support and resistance levels, Sherpa believes SUI will revisit a lower range of $1.29.

However, he warns if Bitcoin dips, SUI could drop down to $1.24.

SUI: Expecting range lows to come eventually around $1.29, but it’s going way lower if Bitcoin shits the bed IMO (In my opinion).

Still, it looks like somewhat accumulation phase as long as BTC is stable.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/Twitter Sui Network is worth $1.31 at time of writing, down 1.9% during the past 24 hours.

Next, the trader weighs in on skyrocketing Pepe (PEPE), a memecoin that launched last month.

He warns Pepe and other meme tokens are likely going to collapse.

PEPE derivatives are going to moon, aka all the other memecoins right now.

But be warned; these are all going to go to $0 and will be short lived.

Full on casino over the next few weeks IMO (in my opinion), same story as it always is.” Lastly, Altcoin Sherpa looks at layer-2 scaling solution Arbitrum (ARB).

He predicts Aribitrum will dip lower by looking at several Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) and the Fibonacci retracement levels.

Traders look at the EMA to determine whether an asset’s price is in a downtrend.

If the price is below the EMA, then the asset is likely going to remain bearish.

ARB: Haven’t paid as much attention to this one lately, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it falls through and goes to the $1.15-$1.20 area again.

This is still a great chain but new flavor of the month (SUI) + memecoin madness (PEPE) are sucking liquidity out of ‘normal’ coins.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/Twitter Arbitrum is worth $1.36 at time of writing, up 3% during the past 24 hours.

The market structure of Shiba Inu pointed downward and the futures market participants were strongly bearish, and SHIB could see further losses.

The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer’s opinion.

Shiba Inu [SHIB] was trading at a significant zone of demand, but the demand appeared extremely weak.

The buyers were fighting an uphill battle to push back the waves of selling pressure.

How much are 1, 10, or 100 SHIB worth today?

At the same time, Bitcoin [BTC] was indecisive and the bulls were unable to drive a move past $30k.

The resistance at $30k meant that a reversal to $27.8k was possible, which could see Shiba Inu post losses over the next few days.

The 6-hour chart showed that there was an H6 bullish order block at the $0.0000099 level (marked in cyan).

This was a relatively significant order block because there was a strong reaction from this area back in March.

However, the retests thereafter were weak.

After facing rejection from the $0.0000117 on 16 April, SHIB sank back to the bullish order block at the aforementioned support level on 21 April.

Yet the bulls were unable to force a strong price reaction upwards.

Instead, the bears continued to apply pressure.

Since 27 April the price has not been able to form a higher high, which was even more apparent on the lower timeframe charts such as 1-hour.

The OBV gradually sunk lower over the past week.

The RSI retested neutral 50 as resistance to show that bearish momentum remained behind Shiba Inu.

The 1-hour chart from Coinalyze showed that the Open Interest has steadily been rising since 29 April.

On 30 April and 1 May, the OI rose alongside falling prices.

This showed extreme bearish pressure and abundant short selling.

Over the past two days, the price saw a lower timeframe rejection from $0.0000102.

The Open Interest soared during this time, indicating bearish speculators.

This supported the idea that Shiba Inu would likely see further losses.

After facing rejection from the $0.0000117 on 16 April, SHIB sank back to the bullish order block at the aforementioned support level on 21 April.

Yet the bulls were unable to force a strong price reaction upwards.

Instead, the bears continued to apply pressure.

Since 27 April the price has not been able to form a higher high, which was even more apparent on the lower timeframe charts such as 1-hour.

The OBV gradually sunk lower over the past week.

The RSI retested neutral 50 as resistance to show that bearish momentum remained behind Shiba Inu.

On 30 April and 1 May, the OI rose alongside falling prices.

This showed extreme bearish pressure and abundant short selling.

Over the past two days, the price saw a lower timeframe rejection from $0.0000102.

The Open Interest soared during this time, indicating bearish speculators.

This supported the idea that Shiba Inu would likely see further losses.

Certain Celsius users, largely those who only ever held funds in custody accounts, had previously been limited to withdrawing up to 94% of their funds.

Crypto lending platform Celsius has reported that certain users will be able to take out 100% of their original funds more than 300 days after the platform froze withdrawals.

In a May 4 announcement, Celsius said eligible users would be able to withdraw the remaining 6% of distributable custody assets from the platform following court approval.

Until January, the same users, largely those who only ever held funds in custody accounts, had been limited to withdrawing up to 94% of their funds.

Earlier this year, the Court approved the distribution of the remaining 6% of Eligible Users’ Distributable Custody Assets (pure custody and transferred custody below $7,575 at the time of transfer) for a total of 100% of Eligible Users’ Distributable Custody Assets.

The announcement marked progress in getting some Celsius customers reimbursed for missing funds for the first time since the company froze withdrawals in June 2022 before filin for bankruptcy in July.

Many Celsius users reported a backlog of withdrawal attempts despite the funds supposedly being available, with some claiming requests had taken a matter of days to process.

I have funds in Custody but can’t withdraw the 36% yet… anyone else having this issue?

According to court filings, Celsius was looking to combine its United Kingdom and United States entities, seemingly to have the two treated the same in bankruptcy proceedings.

Celsius founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky is also facing a lawsuit filed by the New York Attorney General’s office in January.

The median transaction fees on Ethereum surged to its highest point since May 2022, a reflection of growing demand for its ecosystem.

The Ethereum [ETH] network started May on a powerful note by registering a sharp increase in its network activity.

According to a Dune Analytics researcher, the median transaction fees on the largest proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain surged to its highest point since May 2022, a reflection of growing demand for Ethereum’s ecosystem.

Is your portfolio green?

However, the researcher pointed out that most of the demand was coming from the recent memecoin frenzy which saw newbie Pepe [PEPE] being traded extensively on the chain.

PEPE, which made its debut in April 2023, has taken the memecoin space by storm in a short span.

For context, the frog-themed token exploded more than 600% in value over the last week, data from CoinMarketCap revealed.

Over the last 24 hours, the coin’s transaction volume has more than tripled.

Around 36% of the total transactions were settled on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), out of which the ones on the Ethereum chain have taken the cake.

Since the start of May, trades worth $4.77 billion were settled on large Ethereum-based DEXs including Uniswap [UNI], per data from DeFiLlama.

Moreover, the memecoin craze has considerably boosted network traffic on the Ethereum network.

As per data from Santiment, the daily active addresses hit a 2-week high on 3 May.

A large chunk of these were new addresses.

This was evidenced by the impressive network growth exhibited over the last few days.

At the time of writing, ETH exchanged hands at $1,897.69, recording a 24-hour drop of 0.18%, per CoinMarketCap data.

Since the beginning of May, ETH supply on exchanges started to decline while that outside of exchange wallets started to increase.

This signaled that investors started to position themselves bullishly.

On the futures market, ETH witnessed renewed demand as the Open Interest (OI) rose by nearly 4% since the beginning of May.

ETH’s OI went past $6 billion at press time, data from Coinglass showed.

Most of the new trading positions for ETH were positioned for price gains as evidenced by a sharp increase in the Longs/Shorts Ratio over the last 24 hours.

May 6, 2023 Suzuki Shillsalot contributor Suzuki Shillsalot contributor May 6, 2023 Share this article Share Tweet The daily active addresses on Ethereum hit a 2-week high on 3 May.

Since the start of May, trades worth $4.77 billion have been settled on Ethereum-based DEXs The Ethereum [ETH] network started May on a powerful note by registering a sharp increase in its network activity.

A large chunk of these were new addresses.

This was evidenced by the impressive network growth exhibited over the last few days.

This week’s Crypto Biz explores the latest wild wager on Bitcoin prices, inflation fears and the jobs that artificial intelligence may soon replace.

United States inflation and how it might affect the price of Bitcoin (BTC) are two of the top concerns on investors’ minds around the world.

To illustrate, one prominent crypto personality bet big bucks on the future of the U.S.

economy: the former Coinbase executive recently paid out $1.5 million to settle a Twitter wager about possible hyperinflation in the American economy.

The U.S.

may not be experiencing hyperinflation, but the possibility of prices going out of control seems to concern the Federal Reserve.

The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-point on May 3 — to the highest level in 16 years — pushing the target range for its benchmark from 5% to 5.25%.

As inflation pressures continue, Bitcoin is still seen as a safe haven for many, with crypto firms weighing on the digital currency to fight back inflation and turmoil in mainstream finance.

This week’s Crypto Biz explores the latest wild wager on Bitcoin prices, inflation fears and the jobs that artificial intelligence may soon replace.

A closely watched wager between former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan and pseudonymous Twitter user James Medlock has been closed, with Srinivasan paying $1.5 million to settle.

The wager commenced on March 17 when Medlock offered to bet anyone $1 million that the United States would not experience hyperinflation.

A few hours later, the former Coinbase executive accepted the bet, claiming that an impending crisis would lead to the deflation of the U.S.

dollar and, thus, to a hyperinflation scenario, taking the BTC price to $1 million.

As part of the deal, Srinivasan paid Medlock $500,000, donated $500,000 to Bitcoin core developers and gave an additional $500,000 to the nonprofit charity, Give Directly.

The Bitcoin investment strategy is as strong as ever at business intelligence platform MicroStrategy after the company posted its first quarterly profit since 2020.

The firm returned to the green with a profit of $94 million, primarily attributed to a one-time income tax benefit of $453.2 million.

The firm further reduced its leverage by repaying a $161 million Bitcoin-backed loan from the now-collapsed Silverage Bank.

The quarterly results were also impacted by a revenue rise of 2.2% from last year to $121.9 million.

MicroStrategy’s CEO Phong Lee said the firm would continue to execute its dual strategy of growing business intelligence software and acquiring Bitcoin.

Coinbase’s stock price will continue to be “weighed down” until regulators establish the legal “rules of the road” in the United States, Citi analysts say.

The bank downgraded shares of the crypto exchange from “buy” to “neutral” and lowered its price target, citing “too many unknowns” as the company battles it out with regulators.

However, bearish sentiment on Coinbase’s stock is not stopping investment firm ARK Invest from increasing its exposure to the crypto exchange.

ARK purchased 168,869 Coinbase shares for its exchange-traded funds on May 1, worth nearly $8.5 million.

In April, ARK bagged 304,300 shares worth $17.5 million.

Previously, the firm bought 2.4 million shares in March for about $117 million.

Citi's analysis was published prior to Coinbase's Q1 earnings report released on May 4.

IBM is expecting to put a “pause” on hiring for “back-office” roles that could be potentially automated by artificial intelligence instead.

According to the company CEO, Arvind Krishna, back-office positions, such as those in human resources and accounting departments, will likely be the first to be automated by AI.

Nearly 30% of these positions will “easily” be replaced by AI over five years, claimed Krishna in an interview.

IBM employs 282,000 employees globally, according to LinkedIn data.

Non-customer-facing staff sits at nearly 26,000.

The majority of people will have their wealth progressively eaten away by the devaluation of money, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX.

He believes the world’s largest economies will be forced to inflate away the sizeable public debt accumulated in the past years through money printing.

With long-term inflation on the horizon, Hayes’s investment thesis focuses on preserving wealth through investing in digital assets.

United States inflation and how it might affect the price of Bitcoin (BTC) are two of the top concerns on investors’ minds around the world.

To illustrate, one prominent crypto personality bet big bucks on the future of the U.S.

economy: the former Coinbase executive recently paid out $1.5 million to settle a Twitter wager about possible hyperinflation in the American economy. The U.S.

may not be experiencing hyperinflation, but the possibility of prices going out of control seems to concern the Federal Reserve.

The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-point on May 3 — to the highest level in 16 years — pushing the target range for its benchmark from 5% to 5.25%.

As inflation pressures continue, Bitcoin is still seen as a safe haven for many, with crypto firms weighing on the digital currency to fight back inflation and turmoil in mainstream finance.

This week’s Crypto Biz explores the latest wild wager on Bitcoin prices, inflation fears and the jobs that artificial intelligence may soon replace.

Balaji pays out his crazy $1 million Bitcoin bet, 97% under price target A closely watched wager between former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan and pseudonymous Twitter user James Medlock has been closed, with Srinivasan paying $1.5 million to settle.

The wager commenced on March 17 when Medlock offered to bet anyone $1 million that the United States would not experience hyperinflation.

A few hours later, the former Coinbase executive accepted the bet, claiming that an impending crisis would lead to the deflation of the U.S.

dollar and, thus, to a hyperinflation scenario, taking the BTC price to $1 million.

As part of the deal, Srinivasan paid Medlock $500,000, donated $500,000 to Bitcoin core developers and gave an additional $500,000 to the nonprofit charity, Give Directly.

The firm returned to the green with a profit of $94 million, primarily attributed to a one-time income tax benefit of $453.2 million.

The firm further reduced its leverage by repaying a $161 million Bitcoin-backed loan from the now-collapsed Silverage Bank.

The quarterly results were also impacted by a revenue rise of 2.2% from last year to $121.9 million.

MicroStrategy’s CEO Phong Lee said the firm would continue to execute its dual strategy of growing business intelligence software and acquiring Bitcoin.

The firm believes its Bitcoin thesis is a “pretty good way to outperform the market.” Since @MicroStrategy adopted a #Bitcoin Strategy: pic.twitter.com/rrYTbvOkUS— Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) May 1, 2023 Coinbase stock will be ‘weighed down’ until US rules are clear: Citi Coinbase’s stock price will continue to be “weighed down” until regulators establish the legal “rules of the road” in the United States, Citi analysts say.

The bank downgraded shares of the crypto exchange from “buy” to “neutral” and lowered its price target, citing “too many unknowns” as the company battles it out with regulators.

However, bearish sentiment on Coinbase’s stock is not stopping investment firm ARK Invest from increasing its exposure to the crypto exchange.

ARK purchased 168,869 Coinbase shares for its exchange-traded funds on May 1, worth nearly $8.5 million.

In April, ARK bagged 304,300 shares worth $17.5 million.

Previously, the firm bought 2.4 million shares in March for about $117 million.

Citi's analysis was published prior to Coinbase's Q1 earnings report released on May 4.

7,800 jobs at IBM could be replaced by AI within years, CEO suggests IBM is expecting to put a “pause” on hiring for “back-office” roles that could be potentially automated by artificial intelligence instead.

According to the company CEO, Arvind Krishna, back-office positions, such as those in human resources and accounting departments, will likely be the first to be automated by AI.

Nearly 30% of these positions will “easily” be replaced by AI over five years, claimed Krishna in an interview.

IBM employs 282,000 employees globally, according to LinkedIn data.

Non-customer-facing staff sits at nearly 26,000.

Aragon’s key backers doubled down on their controversial banning of Discord members, arguing in a Friday blog post that the decentralized crypto governance project can be a DAO even if its town square is on lockdown.

The statement served to justify Aragon’s exile of at least half a dozen community members for “spamming” Aragon’s Discord server with questions over its finances.

The response escalated a brewing fight between Aragon and a cadre of activist investors who have taken interest in the project’s ANT token and multimillion-dollar treasury.

But the nature of Aragon’s response also raised thorny questions over proper implementation of crypto governance itself, the subject at the center of the Aragon project.

A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a method of governance in which crypto investors vote to decide how a project is run.

Aragon builds tools to help other DAOs operate and is itself partially governed by a DAO.

This week it began moving its treasury toward community control, an effort nearly a year in the making.

While governance decisions over those riches will happen via votes on the blockchain, it is on Discord and project governance forums that members of Aragon’s community – like those at nearly every other DAO – organize their thoughts and coordinate action.

On Wednesday Aragon insiders booted people whose speech was deemed detrimental to the community.

Many – but not all – of the members it exiled are aligned with crypto’s underground activist investor movement, the RFV raiders, who have taken an interest in Aragon.

In its Friday blog post, Aragon declared it would stand firm against them.

The Aragon Association gave no timeline for future efforts to move its treasury to community control.

This week’s governance debacle had concluded with the mass banning and an announcement that Aragon had moved $300,000 of a nearly $70 million treasury to a wallet that the DAO will ultimately operate.

It also gave no timeline for reinstating the banned members to Discord, some of whom told CoinDesk they were also booted from Aragon’s governance forum.

One exiled observer who asked not to be named told CoinDesk the Aragon fight was just getting started.

The statement served to justify Aragon’s exile of at least half a dozen community members for “spamming” Aragon’s Discord server with questions over its finances.The response escalated a brewing fight between Aragon and a cadre of activist investors who have taken interest in the project’s ANT token and multimillion-dollar treasury.

But the nature of Aragon’s response also raised thorny questions over proper implementation of crypto governance itself, the subject at the center of the Aragon project.A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a method of governance in which crypto investors vote to decide how a project is run.

Aragon builds tools to help other DAOs operate and is itself partially governed by a DAO.

This week it began moving its treasury toward community control, an effort nearly a year in the making.While governance decisions over those riches will happen via votes on the blockchain, it is on Discord and project governance forums that members of Aragon’s community – like those at nearly every other DAO – organize their thoughts and coordinate action.On Wednesday Aragon insiders booted people whose speech was deemed detrimental to the community.

Many – but not all – of the members it exiled are aligned with crypto’s underground activist investor movement, the RFV raiders, who have taken an interest in Aragon.

In its Friday blog post, Aragon declared it would stand firm against them.“The AA will continue to carefully and empirically pace our decentralization to ensure that individuals and groups cannot use ANT for personal profit at the expense of building the technology which ANT is intended to govern,” the Aragon Association said.The Aragon Association gave no timeline for future efforts to move its treasury to community control.

This week’s governance debacle had concluded with the mass banning and an announcement that Aragon had moved $300,000 of a nearly $70 million treasury to a wallet that the DAO will ultimately operate.It also gave no timeline for reinstating the banned members to Discord, some of whom told CoinDesk they were also booted from Aragon’s governance forum.One exiled observer who asked not to be named told CoinDesk the Aragon fight was just getting started.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DISCLOSUREPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The statement served to justify Aragon’s exile of at least half a dozen community members for “spamming” Aragon’s Discord server with questions over its finances.The response escalated a brewing fight between Aragon and a cadre of activist investors who have taken interest in the project’s ANT token and multimillion-dollar treasury.

But the nature of Aragon’s response also raised thorny questions over proper implementation of crypto governance itself, the subject at the center of the Aragon project.A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a method of governance in which crypto investors vote to decide how a project is run.

Aragon builds tools to help other DAOs operate and is itself partially governed by a DAO.

This week it began moving its treasury toward community control, an effort nearly a year in the making.While governance decisions over those riches will happen via votes on the blockchain, it is on Discord and project governance forums that members of Aragon’s community – like those at nearly every other DAO – organize their thoughts and coordinate action.On Wednesday Aragon insiders booted people whose speech was deemed detrimental to the community.

Many – but not all – of the members it exiled are aligned with crypto’s underground activist investor movement, the RFV raiders, who have taken an interest in Aragon.

In its Friday blog post, Aragon declared it would stand firm against them.“The AA will continue to carefully and empirically pace our decentralization to ensure that individuals and groups cannot use ANT for personal profit at the expense of building the technology which ANT is intended to govern,” the Aragon Association said.The Aragon Association gave no timeline for future efforts to move its treasury to community control.

This week’s governance debacle had concluded with the mass banning and an announcement that Aragon had moved $300,000 of a nearly $70 million treasury to a wallet that the DAO will ultimately operate.It also gave no timeline for reinstating the banned members to Discord, some of whom told CoinDesk they were also booted from Aragon’s governance forum.One exiled observer who asked not to be named told CoinDesk the Aragon fight was just getting started.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DISCLOSUREPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A major Pepe whale has made a sizable move, transferring an astonishing 4.23 trillion Pepe tokens, equivalent to roughly $15.6 million, to Binance.

The development, which was highlighted by blockchain sleuth Lookonchain, came right on the heels of Pepe's listing on the world's largest crypto exchange earlier today.

The whale's substantial transfer has triggered a wave of speculation about a possible price crash in the near future.

The crypto whale's average buying cost for the tokens was $0.0000002535, indicating a potential profit of around $14.5 million based on the current price.

Lookonchain suggests the whale may decide to sell post the commencement of trading, keeping investors on their toes for a potential shift in price.

With its current ranking at 41, Pepe has been attracting significant attention from investors and traders.

Lookonchain has also noted that the same whale has made a move on TURBO tokens, buying up 755 million of them, currently worth $605,000, with 432,000 USDC.

It remains to be seen whether Pepe has more room to run after recording stunning gains over the past week.

The whale's substantial transfer has triggered a wave of speculation about a possible price crash in the near future.

The crypto whale's average buying cost for the tokens was $0.0000002535, indicating a potential profit of around $14.5 million based on the current price.

Lookonchain suggests the whale may decide to sell post the commencement of trading, keeping investors on their toes for a potential shift in price.

As per data sourced from CoinGecko, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency has surged by an impressive 104.8% on Friday, taking its market cap to over $1.4 billion.

With its current ranking at 41, Pepe has been attracting significant attention from investors and traders.

Lookonchain has also noted that the same whale has made a move on TURBO tokens, buying up 755 million of them, currently worth $605,000, with 432,000 USDC.

It remains to be seen whether Pepe has more room to run after recording stunning gains over the past week.

Bitcoin BTC/USDÂ transaction fees have recently soared, reaching a two-year high with the total fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain amountingÂ to $3.5 million on May 3, marking a 400% increase since late April.

YCharts data indicates that the average Bitcoin transaction fee peaked at $7.20.

The ongoing memecoin trading craze, featuring coins like Pepe Coin PEPE/USD, has inadvertently pushed Bitcoin's transaction costs to multi-year highs.

The current spike in Bitcoin transaction fees is mainly due to a surge in the activity involving BRC-20 transactions.

Galaxy Research data shows, on May 2, BRC-20 transactions accounted for 50% of all Bitcoin transactions.

The BRC-20 token standard, an experimental standard inspired by Ethereum's ERC-20, enables users to issue and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Transaction fees on the #Bitcoin network yesterday reached their highest point in 2 years, both by mean sats/vbyte per transaction in daily cumulative fees paid.

Introduced in March 2023 by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst named Domo, BRC-20 has quickly become a significant trend in the crypto industry, particularly amid the rapid growth of the PEPE memecoin.

Over the past week, the token's value has surged more than 600%, reaching an all-time high of $0.00000216 on May 5.

The Bitcoin blockchain isn't the only one affected by the memecoin frenzy.

Ethereum ETH/USD blockchain gas fees have also recently skyrocketed to new multi-month highs.

On May 2, ETH transaction fees reached an aggregate amount of over $19 million, a level not seen since May 2022, according to Crypto Fees.

Ethereum remains the most expensive network in terms of transaction fees as of this writing.

Nevertheless, the current spike in Bitcoin transaction fees is still far from the all-time high levels.

The highest Bitcoin transaction fees occurred in April 2021, when the average Bitcoin transaction cost nearly hit $70 due to a significant decline in the Bitcoin network hash rate.

Transaction fees reached their previous peak in 2017, surging above $60.

Amazing success stories are widespread in the ever-changing cryptocurrency sector, even if these wins stem from apparently dangerous activity.

After putting their wallet addresses on a Twitter post, crypto fans were recently rewarded with a five-figure airdrop that piqued the community’s interest.

Late last month, WSBMod, a user with over 266,000 followers, asked for users to disclose their Ethereum wallet addresses.

The mysterious message makes no mention of an upcoming token or airdrop.

Nonetheless, a few curious people complied and provided their wallet addresses.

The tweet received little attention at first, but that changed rapidly with the debut of the WSB token on the Ethereum network.

Those who had given their wallet addresses were advised to visit the website and collect their airdrops as soon as they became online.

What happened next was nothing short of amazing.

As the value of the WSB token increased, airdrop recipients quickly realized that their allocations had far exceeded their expectations.

At the time of writing, one claimant reported selling their tokens for more than 7 ETH, which amounted to a stunning $14,000.

The five-figure airdrop spread like wildfire on cryptocurrency Twitter, fuelling the digital asset’s spectacular growth.

However, the token’s value plummeted as airdrop recipients began selling it.

The number of WSB holders has increased in lockstep, nearing 5,000 in 24 hours.

The token’s supposed link to the notorious Wall Street Bets subreddit has most certainly led to its meteoric rise.

Notably, WSB’s liquidity has increased to more than $1.64 million.

While the incredible success story of the WSB token’s airdrop has captured the crypto community’s attention, it’s critical to recognize the potential risks and privacy concerns associated with claiming such airdrops.

Pasting one’s wallet address into the public domain might expose the user to security risks and privacy concerns.

Furthermore, sharing wallet addresses online allows malicious actors to monitor transaction histories and account balances more, potentially identifying high-value targets for scams or phishing attacks.

Participating in airdrops from unknown or unconfirmed sources may also result in the release of fake tokens or phishing schemes in which criminal actors attempt to seize control of users’ wallets.

Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

There may be no regulatory recourse for any loss from such transactions.

Crypto is not a legal tender and is subject to market risks.

At the time of writing, one claimant reported selling their tokens for more than 7 ETH, which amounted to a stunning $14,000.

The five-figure airdrop spread like wildfire on cryptocurrency Twitter, fuelling the digital asset’s spectacular growth.

However, the token’s value plummeted as airdrop recipients began selling it.

The number of WSB holders has increased in lockstep, nearing 5,000 in 24 hours.

The token’s supposed link to the notorious Wall Street Bets subreddit has most certainly led to its meteoric rise.

Notably, WSB’s liquidity has increased to more than $1.64 million.

While the incredible success story of the WSB token’s airdrop has captured the crypto community’s attention, it’s critical to recognize the potential risks and privacy concerns associated with claiming such airdrops.

Pasting one’s wallet address into the public domain might expose the user to security risks and privacy concerns.

Furthermore, sharing wallet addresses online allows malicious actors to monitor transaction histories and account balances more, potentially identifying high-value targets for scams or phishing attacks.

Participating in airdrops from unknown or unconfirmed sources may also result in the release of fake tokens or phishing schemes in which criminal actors attempt to seize control of users’ wallets.

Amazing success stories are widespread in the ever-changing cryptocurrency sector, even if these wins stem from apparently dangerous activity.

After putting their wallet addresses on a Twitter post, crypto fans were recently rewarded with a five-figure airdrop that piqued the community’s interest.

Late last month, WSBMod, a user with over 266,000 followers, asked for users to disclose their Ethereum wallet addresses.

The mysterious message makes no mention of an upcoming token or airdrop.

Nonetheless, a few curious people complied and provided their wallet addresses.

The tweet received little attention at first, but that changed rapidly with the debut of the WSB token on the Ethereum network.

Those who had given their wallet addresses were advised to visit the website and collect their airdrops as soon as they became online.

Pepe (PEPE), the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has seen a remarkable surge in its market cap, rocketing toward the $1 billion mark, according to data from CoinGecko.

The digital currency, linked with the well-known internet meme character Pepe the Frog, has positioned itself as a formidable competitor in the meme coin arena, rivaling Shiba Inu (SHIB).

In just the last 24 hours, Pepe has surged by another 78%, with its 24-hour trading volume exceeding a whopping $610 million.

Pepe’s recent listing on BitMEX, one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, has contributed to this surge.

The listing allows users to trade Pepe against the US dollar and Tether with up to 50x leverage.

Pepe is now available on other significant exchanges such as OKX, MEXC Global, Huobi, and Gate.io, further validating the asset and potentially attracting more traders.

However, it’s important to note that Pepe primarily serves as a speculative instrument, experiencing a 15% drop over the past 24 hours.

Despite its speculative nature, one notable investor dubbed ‘SmartMoney’ has reaped significant gains from the memecoin alongside Shiba Inu, underscoring the potential for significant returns.

However, the soaring market cap and trading volume of Pepe also raise concerns about market manipulation, highlighting the need for investors to exercise caution and due diligence.

While remarkable, Pepe’s meteoric rise further underlines the unpredictable and speculative cryptocurrency market.

As such, it’s essential for investors to thoroughly research and understand the risks before investing in these highly volatile, meme-inspired cryptocurrencies.

In conclusion, Pepe’s market cap and trading volume surge is a significant milestone for the meme-inspired cryptocurrency.

While it signals the potential for significant returns, investors should exercise caution and carefully approach Pepe and other highly volatile cryptocurrencies.

As always, it’s important to do your own research and seek the advice of a financial professional before making any investment decisions.

Polkadot’s weighted sentiments improved last week, and they can get better with this new partnership.

However, DOT’s price was slow to respond to the update.

Polkadot [DOT] maintained its streak of dominating other blockchains in terms of development activity.

As per Santiment’s latest tweet, Polkadot ranked one on the list of the blockchains with the highest GitHub commits in the last 30 days, surpassing Cardano [ADA] and Cosmos [ATOM].

The sentiments around DOT also improved considerably over the last seven days, which looked good as DOT’s price suffered a blow.

The crypto community’s sentiment around DOT might see an uptick soon as Polkadot made a major announcement.

Polkadot struck a partnership deal with auditing giant Deloitte, which in itself is a news of great importance.

As per the official announcement, Deloitte chose KILT, a Polkadot’s parachain, to enhance its identity protocols.

With this partnership, Deloitte will leverage KILT’s reusable digital identity credentials to support its Know Your Customer/Know Your Business processes.

DOT mentioned in the Twitter thread that KILT’s technology will eliminate existing inefficiencies around KYC/KYB processes that can put consumer data privacy at risk.

It will also address regulatory compliance for banking and DeFi, age verification for e-commerce, private logins, and fundraising.

However, things were slow to reflect on Polkadot’s price chart as its value increased marginally in the last 24 hours.

According to CoinMarketCap, DOT’s price was still over 1.7% lower than last week.

At the time of writing, it was trading at $5.77 with a market capitalization of more than $6.8 billion.

Santiment’s chart revealed that DOT’s 1-day price volatility declined, which further decreased the chances of a price uptick.

However, Lunarcrush’s data pointed out that bullish sentiment around DOT increased by over 11% in the last 24 hours, which was a positive signal.

Additionally, Polkadot’s funding rates were relatively high, suggesting high demand in the derivatives market.

Is your portfolio green?

Polkadot’s daily chart nonetheless, gave hope for a price uptrend as a few of the market indicators were in the bulls’ favor.

For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick.

DOT’s Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed the same route, which looked bullish.

However, nothing can be said with certainty as the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon’s finding was bearish.

As per the chart, the distance between the 20-day EMA and the 55-day EMA was increasing, indicating a bearish upper hand in the market.

Polkadot’s development activity remained high over the last 30 days.

A few on-chain metrics and market indicators were bullish on DOT.

Polkadot [DOT] maintained its streak of dominating other blockchains in terms of development activity.

As per Santiment’s latest tweet, Polkadot ranked one on the list of the blockchains with the highest GitHub commits in the last 30 days, surpassing Cardano [ADA] and Cosmos [ATOM].

Top #crypto development activity, notable #github commits tracked by @santimentfeed, past 30 days: 1 @polkadot $DOT2 @kusamanetwork $KSM3 @Cardano $ADA4 @hedera $HBAR5 @dfinity $ICP6 @cosmos $ATOM7 @ethstatus $SNT8 @decentraland $MANA9 @ethereum $ETH10 @iota $MIOTA pic.twitter.com/A6ZtMGROaA — Santiment (@santimentfeed) May 5, 2023 Read Polkadot’s [DOT] Price Prediction 2023-24 The sentiments around DOT also improved considerably over the last seven days, which looked good as DOT’s price suffered a blow.

The crypto community’s sentiment around DOT might see an uptick soon as Polkadot made a major announcement.

Source: Santiment Polkadot’s latest partnership Polkadot struck a partnership deal with auditing giant Deloitte, which in itself is a news of great importance.

As per the official announcement, Deloitte chose KILT, a Polkadot’s parachain, to enhance its identity protocols.

1/ @DeloitteCH – the world’s biggest accounting firm – is the latest major enterprise partner to come to the Polkadot ecosystem, choosing cutting-edge tech provided by the @Kiltprotocol parachain to enhance its identity protocols. pic.twitter.com/nkqr0i1s0I — Polkadot (@Polkadot) May 4, 2023 With this partnership, Deloitte will leverage KILT’s reusable digital identity credentials to support its Know Your Customer/Know Your Business processes.

DOT mentioned in the Twitter thread that KILT’s technology will eliminate existing inefficiencies around KYC/KYB processes that can put consumer data privacy at risk.

It will also address regulatory compliance for banking and DeFi, age verification for e-commerce, private logins, and fundraising.

DOT was slow to respond However, things were slow to reflect on Polkadot’s price chart as its value increased marginally in the last 24 hours.

According to CoinMarketCap, DOT’s price was still over 1.7% lower than last week.

At the time of writing, it was trading at $5.77 with a market capitalization of more than $6.8 billion.

Santiment’s chart revealed that DOT’s 1-day price volatility declined, which further decreased the chances of a price uptick.

Source: Santiment However, Lunarcrush’s data pointed out that bullish sentiment around DOT increased by over 11% in the last 24 hours, which was a positive signal.

Additionally, Polkadot’s funding rates were relatively high, suggesting high demand in the derivatives market.

Is your portfolio green?

Check the Polkadot Profit Calculator The daily chart shows signs of recovery Polkadot’s daily chart nonetheless, gave hope for a price uptrend as a few of the market indicators were in the bulls’ favor.

For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) registered an uptick.

DOT’s Money Flow Index (MFI) also followed the same route, which looked bullish.

However, nothing can be said with certainty as the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Ribbon’s finding was bearish.

As per the chart, the distance between the 20-day EMA and the 55-day EMA was increasing, indicating a bearish upper hand in the market.

Pepe Coin is a meme coin based on the Pepe the Frog meme, with the latter gaining popularity on the internet in the mid-2010s.

Pepe has been used as a meme in various contexts, often to convey humour or sarcasm.

PEPE as a cryptocurrency entered the crypto market in April and has since made staggering gains, despite the creators stating that the value of PEPE is primarily based on speculation and hype rather than any intrinsic value or use case.

Memecoins are cryptocurrencies based on internet memes or pop culture references created for entertainment or as a joke.

Some examples include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Baby Doge, and Floki Inu.

While their prices fluctuate significantly, they are considered highly speculative and risky investments due to their lack of underlying value or use case.

Pepe Coin is a newer meme coin gaining traction and may signal a shift away from dog-themed coins.

Pepe Coin was launched without the use of traditional methods such as an ICO, presale, or airdrop, relying solely on the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme to generate investor interest.

Within days of its launch, its price increased by 2000%, propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of more than $396 million.

The number of wallets holding PEPE has increased from 7000 in mid-April to 79000 at the start of May.

The coin has set itself the goal to surpass Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, according to its website.

It can be traded on Uniswap, OKX, and Houbi, amongst others, a be listed on nd is on the verge of going live on major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken.

Crypto Twitter is in full anticipation that it will soon be listed and that explosive growth will continue.

Last weekend, traders experienced significant slippage when trying to convert large amounts of PEPE into other currencies, like ETH, due to a lack of liquidity despite a recent rise in liquidity pool activity.

With a self-reported circulating supply of 420.69 trillion PEPE tokens compared to a circulating supply of 139.22 billion DOGE, it is difficult to see how many newcomers are needed to reach similar volumes, and it remains to be seen how many people will buy into the latest meme graze.

Additionally, it must be said that PEPE has no intrinsic value and does not appear to have plans to add any features.

Pepe Coin’s future is uncertain, with some experts predicting it will remain significant, while others believe it will follow in the footsteps of other short-lived meme coins such as Grimacecoin and Pump Coin.

Grimacecoin, for example, experienced a brief increase in value following a McDonald’s tweet, but its price eventually returned to its original level.

According to the developers’ website, investors may want to consider the following because “$PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return.

There is no formal team or roadmap.

Then again, internet memes, especially crypto meme coins, are notoriously difficult to predict, and PEPE sees itself as the king of memes.

PEPE as a cryptocurrency entered the crypto market in April and has since made staggering gains, despite the creators stating that the value of PEPE is primarily based on speculation and hype rather than any intrinsic value or use case.

Memecoins are cryptocurrencies based on internet memes or pop culture references created for entertainment or as a joke.

Some examples include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Baby Doge, and Floki Inu.

While their prices fluctuate significantly, they are considered highly speculative and risky investments due to their lack of underlying value or use case.

Pepe Coin is a newer meme coin gaining traction and may signal a shift away from dog-themed coins.

Pepe Coin was launched without the use of traditional methods such as an ICO, presale, or airdrop, relying solely on the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme to generate investor interest.

Within days of its launch, its price increased by 2000%, propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of more than $396 million.

The number of wallets holding PEPE has increased from 7000 in mid-April to 79000 at the start of May.

The coin has set itself the goal to surpass Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, according to its website.

It can be traded on Uniswap, OKX, and Houbi, amongst others, a be listed on nd is on the verge of going live on major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken.

Crypto Twitter is in full anticipation that it will soon be listed and that explosive growth will continue.

Last weekend, traders experienced significant slippage when trying to convert large amounts of PEPE into other currencies, like ETH, due to a lack of liquidity despite a recent rise in liquidity pool activity.

Advertisement &nbsp &nbsp With a self-reported circulating supply of 420.69 trillion PEPE tokens compared to a circulating supply of 139.22 billion DOGE, it is difficult to see how many newcomers are needed to reach similar volumes, and it remains to be seen how many people will buy into the latest meme graze.

Additionally, it must be said that PEPE has no intrinsic value and does not appear to have plans to add any features.

Pepe Coin’s future is uncertain, with some experts predicting it will remain significant, while others believe it will follow in the footsteps of other short-lived meme coins such as Grimacecoin and Pump Coin.

Grimacecoin, for example, experienced a brief increase in value following a McDonald’s tweet, but its price eventually returned to its original level.

According to the developers’ website, investors may want to consider the following because “$PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return.

There is no formal team or roadmap.

The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.” Then again, internet memes, especially crypto meme coins, are notoriously difficult to predict, and PEPE sees itself as the king of memes.

The Ethereum ETH/USD network has recently been confronted with a worrying issue for its users – the escalating gas consumption rates on the platform.

Gas fees, which are levied for processing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, have been increasing at an unsettling pace.

Data scientist Hildobby shared information from Dune, revealing that the median ETH gas price, measured in gwei and averaged over a week, reached 87.

This peak hasn't been seen in the past year – since May 2022.

The average transaction fee is now around $50, a marked rise from just a few months ago, when it was below $10.

High gas fees have led to user dissatisfaction, as even straightforward transactions have become progressively more expensive.

Many users, such as dApp developers, traders, and retail investors, are finding it challenging to engage with the Ethereum ecosystem due to exorbitant gas fees.

The primary cause of this issue is the surging demand for transaction processing on the network, driven by the re-emergence of memecoins in the market after nearly two years of silence.

In recent weeks, memecoin trading has accelerated, with the majority of activity taking place on the Ethereum blockchain.

PEPE, a memecoin whose market cap topped $1 billion in the two weeks following its mid-April launch, serves as an example.

Other memecoins that have experienced substantial hype include ArbDogeAI (AIDOGE), WOJAK WOJAK/USD, and AiShiba SHIBAI/USD.

Another contributing factor to elevated ETH gas fees is the resurgence of NFT trading on the Ethereum blockchain.

While trading volumes fell significantly in April, reports indicate they reached $4.7 billion in Q1 2023, a 137% increase from the previous year.

Glassnode, a blockchain intelligence platform, disclosed that gas consumption for NFT-related activities on Ethereum rose by 94% between January and February.

The Ethereum community is diligently working on solutions to alleviate this problem, such as the introduction of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844.

The proposal aims to decrease gas fees and transaction throughput by incorporating a new transaction type that accepts "blobs" of data.

In the interim, users have had to adapt their strategies.

Some have chosen to execute transactions during off-peak hours when gas fees are usually lower, while others have migrated to alternative blockchain networks with lower fees or adopted layer 2 scaling solutions like Polygon MATIC/USD to cut transaction costs.

Ethereum Network Gasps For Air: NFT And Memecoin Boom Sends Gas Prices Through The Roofby Murtuza Merchant, Benzinga Staff Writer May 5, 2023 3:08 PM | 2 min read Zinger Key PointsMemecoin resurgence, NFT trading boom contributes to rising Ethereum gas feesBlockchain alternatives gained traction amid Ethereum gas fee fiasco.The Ethereum ETH/USD network has recently been confronted with a worrying issue for its users – the escalating gas consumption rates on the platform.Gas fees, which are levied for processing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, have been increasing at an unsettling pace.

Data scientist Hildobby shared information from Dune, revealing that the median ETH gas price, measured in gwei and averaged over a week, reached 87.This peak hasn't been seen in the past year – since May 2022.The average transaction fee is now around $50, a marked rise from just a few months ago, when it was below $10.High gas fees have led to user dissatisfaction, as even straightforward transactions have become progressively more expensive.Many users, such as dApp developers, traders, and retail investors, are finding it challenging to engage with the Ethereum ecosystem due to exorbitant gas fees.

The primary cause of this issue is the surging demand for transaction processing on the network, driven by the re-emergence of memecoins in the market after nearly two years of silence.In recent weeks, memecoin trading has accelerated, with the majority of activity taking place on the Ethereum blockchain.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is nearing the $2,000 price level once more.

It is currently trading at $1,981.32, according to CoinGecko data.

The 5.7% uptick in Ethereum's price comes alongside a 24-hour trading volume of over $10 billion.

Ethereum's price rise coincides with a record amount of ETH burned over the past 24 hours.

David Hoffman, an Ethereum enthusiast, tweeted that a staggering 10,300 ETH had been burned, with about half of that amount consumed by Uniswap trades.

The increase in ETH burning is due to the current memecoin season taking place predominantly on the Ethereum mainnet, causing gas fees to rise and leading to more ETH being burned.

According to crypto analyst Mercek, the supply of ETH has decreased by 0.80% in the last 30 days, with the ongoing meme season potentially doubling the burn rate.

Mercek suggests that the longer the meme season lasts, the more ETH will be burned, positively impacting ETH holders even if they dislike memecoins.

In other Ethereum news, open interest (OI) in ETH is also seeing a significant uptick.

Byzantine General, a crypto analyst, noted that Ethereum's OI is "getting pretty crazy."

Coinglass data shows that Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has the highest OI in ETH, with 1.27 million, representing 37.19% of total open interest.

This increase in open interest suggests a growing number of investors are betting on Ethereum's future price movements, adding another layer of bullish sentiment to the current market outlook.

Ethereum (ETH) Approaching $2,000 Mark Yet Again Facebook Twitter Telegram Copy URL News Fri, 05/05/2023 - 19:06 Alex Dovbnya The second-largest cryptocurrency is inching closer to the $2,000 mark Cover image via stock.adobe.com Read U.TODAY on Google News Contents ETH burning reaches new highsOpen interest gaining momentum Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is nearing the $2,000 price level once more.

It is currently trading at $1,981.32, according to CoinGecko data. The 5.7% uptick in Ethereum's price comes alongside a 24-hour trading volume of over $10 billion.

ETH burning reaches new highs Ethereum's price rise coincides with a record amount of ETH burned over the past 24 hours.

David Hoffman, an Ethereum enthusiast, tweeted that a staggering 10,300 ETH had been burned, with about half of that amount consumed by Uniswap trades.

The increase in ETH burning is due to the current memecoin season taking place predominantly on the Ethereum mainnet, causing gas fees to rise and leading to more ETH being burned.

RelatedTerra's Do Kwon Facing 40 Years in Prison According to crypto analyst Mercek, the supply of ETH has decreased by 0.80% in the last 30 days, with the ongoing meme season potentially doubling the burn rate.

Mercek suggests that the longer the meme season lasts, the more ETH will be burned, positively impacting ETH holders even if they dislike memecoins.

Open interest gaining momentum In other Ethereum news, open interest (OI) in ETH is also seeing a significant uptick.

Byzantine General, a crypto analyst, noted that Ethereum's OI is "getting pretty crazy."

Coinglass data shows that Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has the highest OI in ETH, with 1.27 million, representing 37.19% of total open interest.

This increase in open interest suggests a growing number of investors are betting on Ethereum's future price movements, adding another layer of bullish sentiment to the current market outlook.

Cryptocurrency is a volatile market; do your independent research and only invest what you can afford to lose.

New token launches and small market capitalization coins are inherently more risky than large cap cryptocurrencies.

These tokens are subject to larger liquidity and market risks.

Bitcoin has not moved much lately, and that is having a ripple effect on most cryptocurrencies apart from newly launched meme coins like PEPE.

This week, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization mainly traded sideways, creating a tight price squeeze heading into the weekend.

On Friday, Bitcoin was trading at $29,000, up 0.33% in the past 24 hours and down roughly 1% in the past week.

According to onchain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin’s recent behaviour can be pointed to constant selling by short-term holders.

In its latest weekly on-chain newsletter, the firm noted that whereas the majority of supply remains held by longer-term, the weight of short-term investors is currently prevailing over the price action within the uptrend.

As per the firm, since early Jan, there have been two waves of profit-taking by short-term holders, surpassing the total profit taken by long-term holders.

Within the current market, the second wave of short-term holders profit realization aligns with the recent correction,” it added.

The firm noted that as this cohort continues to sell its coins, the market will likely experience volatility, and Bitcoin could slide lower.

However, it is important to note that as small-term holders continue to take profit, large whales with over 10,000 BTC seem to be accumulating.

Instead, he noted it showed the behaviour of ‘ETF-style sinks though like MicroStrategy, large institutions, GBTC, and WBTC over the last 30 days.

This implies that these institutions could have significantly prevented Bitcoin’s price from declining recently.

This week, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization mainly traded sideways, creating a tight price squeeze heading into the weekend.

On Friday, Bitcoin was trading at $29,000, up 0.33% in the past 24 hours and down roughly 1% in the past week.

According to onchain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin’s recent behaviour can be pointed to constant selling by short-term holders.

Short-Term Holders Offload BTC In its latest weekly on-chain newsletter, the firm noted that whereas the majority of supply remains held by longer-term, the weight of short-term investors is currently prevailing over the price action within the uptrend.

Among both Long-Term and Short-Term Holder cohorts sending coins to exchanges, the dominance of the Short-Term Holders remains a consistent 90%-95% of total inflows,” wrote Glassnode.

Of note is the increase of profit taking by STHs in 2023, denoted by the deeper dark red zone, which accounts for 58% of exchange inflows at present.” Advertisement &nbsp &nbsp As per the firm, since early Jan, there have been two waves of profit-taking by short-term holders, surpassing the total profit taken by long-term holders.

Within the current market, the second wave of short-term holders profit realization aligns with the recent correction,” it added.

The firm noted that as this cohort continues to sell its coins, the market will likely experience volatility, and Bitcoin could slide lower.

We observed that sell pressure by new investors was a key driving force that established resistance at $30k.

Should this present correction resume, the cost basis of the young supply holders at $24.4k may well be a psychological level to monitor in the weeks ahead.” Large Whales Deviate To Buying However, it is important to note that as small-term holders continue to take profit, large whales with over 10,000 BTC seem to be accumulating.

On Friday, Glassnode tweeted that this group has shifted “from a distributive regime to one of aggressive coin absorption.” “Checkmate”, the lead onchain analyst at the firm, later clarified the tweet, noting that this metric excludes exchanges.

Instead, he noted it showed the behaviour of ‘ETF-style sinks though like MicroStrategy, large institutions, GBTC, and WBTC over the last 30 days.

This implies that these institutions could have significantly prevented Bitcoin’s price from declining recently.

Top US crypto exchange Coinbase is rolling out trading support for an under-the-radar cross-chain bridge altcoin built on Ethereum (ETH).

Formerly known as Anyswap, the project launched in July 2020 and has processed $103.45 billion in total volume.

It currently supports 92 different chains.

Multichain currently ranks third among all cross-chain bridge projects in terms of total value locked (TVL), with $1.8 billion at time of writing, according to DeFiLlama.

The TVL of a blockchain represents the total capital held within its smart contracts.

TVL is calculated by multiplying the amount of collateral locked into the network by the current value of the assets.

MULTI, the protocol’s governance token, is trading at $9.12 at time of writing.

The 199th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down 3.73% in the past 24 hours and more than 5.1% in the past seven days.

The token is also nearly 73% down from its all-time high of $33.64, which it hit in January 2022.

Coinbase announced it was adding MULTI to its listing roadmap last month.

The exchange created the listing roadmap last year to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of front-running their listing announcements.

33.64, which it hit in January 2022.

Top US Crypto Exchange Coinbase Rolls Out Official Trading Support for Ethereum-Based Cross-Chain Bridge Altcoin by Daily Hodl Staff May 5, 2023 in Altcoins, Ethereum, Trading Top US crypto exchange Coinbase is rolling out trading support for an under-the-radar cross-chain bridge altcoin built on Ethereum (ETH).

The exchange’s customers can now trade Multichain (MULTI), a cross-chain protocol that aims to be “the ultimate router for Web 3.0.” Formerly known as Anyswap, the project launched in July 2020 and has processed $103.45 billion in total volume.

It currently supports 92 different chains.

Multichain currently ranks third among all cross-chain bridge projects in terms of total value locked (TVL), with $1.8 billion at time of writing, according to DeFiLlama.

The TVL of a blockchain represents the total capital held within its smart contracts.

TVL is calculated by multiplying the amount of collateral locked into the network by the current value of the assets.

MULTI, the protocol’s governance token, is trading at $9.12 at time of writing.

The 199th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down 3.73% in the past 24 hours and more than 5.1% in the past seven days.

The token is also nearly 73% down from its all-time high of $33.64, which it hit in January 2022.

Coinbase announced it was adding MULTI to its listing roadmap last month.

The exchange created the listing roadmap last year to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of front-running their listing announcements.

South Korean authorities are looking to extradite embattled Terra (LUNA) founder Do Kwon months after he was found in the Eastern European nation of Montenegro.

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, the leading prosecutor in the case says that bringing Kwon back to South Korea would be the best way to obtain justice for the victims of last year’s multi-billion-dollar collapse of the Terra ecosystem.

Kwon is accused of making false claims about the digital assets he launched as a part of the Terra ecosystem as well as creating trading bots to falsely boost the transaction numbers of TerraUSD, the protocol’s failed algorithmic stablecoin.

Currently, South Korea is in the midst of talking to U.S.

prosecutors to extradite Kwon from Montenegro, where he’s been held by authorities since March, according to the report.

According to lead prosecutor Dan Sung-han, even though some of Kwon’s fraudulent actions took place in the United States, the evidence suggests that much of it took place in South Korea.

Dan added that if convicted, Kwon could face the largest prison sentence ever handed out for financial crimes in South Korea, which would be over 40 years.

Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March after attempting to board a flight to the United Arab Emirates with a forged Costa Rican passport.

He is also facing charges from the U.S.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly violating securities laws, which he asked a court to dismiss last month.

The Terra ecosystem’s troubles began last May after both its native assets LUNA and TerraUSD collapsed, leading to about $40 billion in losses.

Prosecutors Seek To Extradite Embattled Terra Founder Do Kwon to South Korea: Report by Mehron Rokhy May 5, 2023 in Regulators, Scams, Schemes and Hacks South Korean authorities are looking to extradite embattled Terra (LUNA) founder Do Kwon months after he was found in the Eastern European nation of Montenegro.

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, the leading prosecutor in the case says that bringing Kwon back to South Korea would be the best way to obtain justice for the victims of last year’s multi-billion-dollar collapse of the Terra ecosystem.

Kwon is accused of making false claims about the digital assets he launched as a part of the Terra ecosystem as well as creating trading bots to falsely boost the transaction numbers of TerraUSD, the protocol’s failed algorithmic stablecoin.

Currently, South Korea is in the midst of talking to U.S.

prosecutors to extradite Kwon from Montenegro, where he’s been held by authorities since March, according to the report.

According to lead prosecutor Dan Sung-han, even though some of Kwon’s fraudulent actions took place in the United States, the evidence suggests that much of it took place in South Korea.

As stated by Dan in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, “Given the nature of this incident, we think investigating the case in South Korea would be the most efficient way of bringing justice” Dan added that if convicted, Kwon could face the largest prison sentence ever handed out for financial crimes in South Korea, which would be over 40 years.

Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March after attempting to board a flight to the United Arab Emirates with a forged Costa Rican passport.

He is also facing charges from the U.S.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly violating securities laws, which he asked a court to dismiss last month.

The Terra ecosystem’s troubles began last May after both its native assets LUNA and TerraUSD collapsed, leading to about $40 billion in losses.

Prosecutors Seek To Extradite Embattled Terra Founder Do Kwon to South Korea: Report by Mehron Rokhy May 5, 2023 in Regulators, Scams, Schemes and Hacks South Korean authorities are looking to extradite embattled Terra (LUNA) founder Do Kwon months after he was found in the Eastern European nation of Montenegro.

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, the leading prosecutor in the case says that bringing Kwon back to South Korea would be the best way to obtain justice for the victims of last year’s multi-billion-dollar collapse of the Terra ecosystem.

Kwon is accused of making false claims about the digital assets he launched as a part of the Terra ecosystem as well as creating trading bots to falsely boost the transaction numbers of TerraUSD, the protocol’s failed algorithmic stablecoin.

Currently, South Korea is in the midst of talking to U.S.

prosecutors to extradite Kwon from Montenegro, where he’s been held by authorities since March, according to the report.

According to lead prosecutor Dan Sung-han, even though some of Kwon’s fraudulent actions took place in the United States, the evidence suggests that much of it took place in South Korea.

As stated by Dan in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, “Given the nature of this incident, we think investigating the case in South Korea would be the most efficient way of bringing justice” Dan added that if convicted, Kwon could face the largest prison sentence ever handed out for financial crimes in South Korea, which would be over 40 years.

Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March after attempting to board a flight to the United Arab Emirates with a forged Costa Rican passport.

He is also facing charges from the U.S.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly violating securities laws, which he asked a court to dismiss last month.

The Terra ecosystem’s troubles began last May after both its native assets LUNA and TerraUSD collapsed, leading to about $40 billion in losses.

Cardano begins its sojourn into the Layer 2 world as it launches its first Hydra head to increase the network’s scalability and transaction speeds.

As legacy Layer 1 (L1) blockchain networks strive to become more scalable, leading L1 blockchain Cardano announced the release of the first Hydra head on its mainnet.

This marks a major milestone for the network, paving the way for a new era of scalability on the chain.

Hydra is a family of layer 2 protocols designed to make #Cardano more scalable and adaptable for various use cases that require fast and cheap transactions.

The first Hydra head recently opened on mainnet.

With the ability to make transactions cheaper and faster on the Cardano network, the launch of the first Hydra head is expected to significantly scale up Cardano’s transactions per second (TPS) to 1 million from the 250 it sat at before the release of Hydra.

In addition, as decentralized finance (DeFi) projects launch on the L2 network, Cardano’s total value locked (TVL) is expected to climb even further.

As previously reported, Cardano’s TVL increased consistently over the last six months.

According to the on-chain data provider Artemis, the seven-day moving average of the chain’s TVL was $154 million, a level last observed in May 2022.

Over the last six months, $ADA TVL has consistently increased.

As of this writing, Cardano’s TVL was $153.96 million, per data from DefiLlama.

At press time, ADA exchanged hands at $0.3911.

Since the middle of April, the coin has posted a double-digit decline of 13%, falling from a high of $0.45 reached on 15 April.

The decline in ADA’s value within this period could be partly attributable to a fall in its network activity.

According to data from Santiment, the count of daily active addresses that traded the L1 coin during the period under review fell consistently by over 50%.

With many of its holders still at a loss, negative sentiment continued to trail to ADA.

The token’s MVRV ratio remained in negative territory since 27 April.

Is your portfolio green?

At the time of writing, the ratio was recorded at -41.60%, meaning that if all ADA holders sold at its current value, they would incur losses on their investments.

Lastly, ADA’s Open Interests has dipped by 18% since 15 April.

Still in a downtrend at press time, this showed that interest in trading ADA remained low, occasioning a reduced trading volume and increased volatility.

ADA holders continue to record losses as negative sentiment overruns the market.

As legacy Layer 1 (L1) blockchain networks strive to become more scalable, leading L1 blockchain Cardano announced the release of the first Hydra head on its mainnet.

This marks a major milestone for the network, paving the way for a new era of scalability on the chain.

Hydra is a family of layer 2 protocols designed to make #Cardano more scalable and adaptable for various use cases that require fast and cheap transactions.

The first Hydra head recently opened on mainnet.

In addition, as decentralized finance (DeFi) projects launch on the L2 network, Cardano’s total value locked (TVL) is expected to climb even further.

As previously reported, Cardano’s TVL increased consistently over the last six months.

According to the on-chain data provider Artemis, the seven-day moving average of the chain’s TVL was $154 million, a level last observed in May 2022.

Since the middle of April, the coin has posted a double-digit decline of 13%, falling from a high of $0.45 reached on 15 April.

The decline in ADA’s value within this period could be partly attributable to a fall in its network activity.

According to data from Santiment, the count of daily active addresses that traded the L1 coin during the period under review fell consistently by over 50%.

The token’s MVRV ratio remained in negative territory since 27 April.

Still in a downtrend at press time, this showed that interest in trading ADA remained low, occasioning a reduced trading volume and increased volatility.

ADA holders continue to record losses as negative sentiment overruns the market.

As legacy Layer 1 (L1) blockchain networks strive to become more scalable, leading L1 blockchain Cardano announced the release of the first Hydra head on its mainnet.

This marks a major milestone for the network, paving the way for a new era of scalability on the chain.

In addition, as decentralized finance (DeFi) projects launch on the L2 network, Cardano’s total value locked (TVL) is expected to climb even further.

As previously reported, Cardano’s TVL increased consistently over the last six months.

According to the on-chain data provider Artemis, the seven-day moving average of the chain’s TVL was $154 million, a level last observed in May 2022.

Since the middle of April, the coin has posted a double-digit decline of 13%, falling from a high of $0.45 reached on 15 April.

The decline in ADA’s value within this period could be partly attributable to a fall in its network activity.

The bewilderingly fast rise of pepecoin (PEPE), a meme coin introduced mere weeks ago that’s now worth more than $1 billion, is making gigantic fortunes for those undeterred by warnings this is a fad that will end badly.

A perfect example: a pseudonymous trader named dimethyltryptamine.eth spent $263 just three weeks ago to buy trillions of PEPE tokens.

That former pittance has turned into $3.8 million in profits from tokens they’ve already sold, and their remaining holdings are worth about $9 million, according to data by blockchain research firm Arkham Intelligence.

That’s an almost 5,000,000% profit.

The trader is benefitting from the breakneck rally of a coin based on the “pepe the frog” meme, a popular symbol in crypto circles.

Launched in April, the meme coin’s market capitalization astonishingly surpassed $1 billion on Friday and, according to CoinGecko, at one point was worth more than Arbitrum’s ARB, which is also among the hottest newly issued tokens of 2023.

Analysts, however, have raised concerns about the concentrated ownership of pepecoin, pointing to a handful of traders acquiring substantial amounts of PEPE when the token was released last month.

Blockchain sleuth Lookonchain unveiled five accounts connected to a wallet belonging to pepecexwallet.eth, which received funds directly from the token’s deployer contract, acquired over 8.87 trillion PEPE after issuance for just $385.

Dimethyltryptamine.eth, which wasn’t cited among the insider wallets by Lookonchain but belongs among the earliest buyers, purchased 5.907 trillion of PEPE tokens for $263 in two transactions on April 14 using UniSwap, Arkham shows.

The trader also paid $17 for gas fees.

Since then, the trader has been gradually taking profits by sending smaller amounts multiple times a day to UniSwap, and receiving ether (ETH) in exchange.

The wallet has sent $3.8 million of PEPE to UniSwap in the past month, per Arkham data, presumably to take profits, with $2.4 million of that transferred in the past 24 hours.

Pepecoin trader has been taking profits.

He holds BTC and ETH.Follow @sndr_krisztian on TwitterThe bewilderingly fast rise of pepecoin (PEPE), a meme coin introduced mere weeks ago that’s now worth more than $1 billion, is making gigantic fortunes for those undeterred by warnings this is a fad that will end badly.A perfect example: a pseudonymous trader named dimethyltryptamine.eth spent $263 just three weeks ago to buy trillions of PEPE tokens.

That former pittance has turned into $3.8 million in profits from tokens they’ve already sold, and their remaining holdings are worth about $9 million, according to data by blockchain research firm Arkham Intelligence.

That’s an almost 5,000,000% profit.The trader is benefitting from the breakneck rally of a coin based on the “pepe the frog” meme, a popular symbol in crypto circles.

Launched in April, the meme coin’s market capitalization astonishingly surpassed $1 billion on Friday and, according to CoinGecko, at one point was worth more than Arbitrum’s ARB, which is also among the hottest newly issued tokens of 2023.Analysts, however, have raised concerns about the concentrated ownership of pepecoin, pointing to a handful of traders acquiring substantial amounts of PEPE when the token was released last month.

Blockchain sleuth Lookonchain unveiled five accounts connected to a wallet belonging to pepecexwallet.eth, which received funds directly from the token’s deployer contract, acquired over 8.87 trillion PEPE after issuance for just $385.Dimethyltryptamine.eth, which wasn’t cited among the insider wallets by Lookonchain but belongs among the earliest buyers, purchased 5.907 trillion of PEPE tokens for $263 in two transactions on April 14 using UniSwap, Arkham shows.

The trader also paid $17 for gas fees.Since then, the trader has been gradually taking profits by sending smaller amounts multiple times a day to UniSwap, and receiving ether (ETH) in exchange.

The wallet has sent $3.8 million of PEPE to UniSwap in the past month, per Arkham data, presumably to take profits, with $2.4 million of that transferred in the past 24 hours.Pepecoin trader has been taking profits.

and still holds about $9 million of PEPE after selling several million dollars worth, according to data from blockchain platform Arkham.By Krisztian SandorMay 5, 2023 at 6:29 p.m.

He holds BTC and ETH.Follow @sndr_krisztian on TwitterThe bewilderingly fast rise of pepecoin (PEPE), a meme coin introduced mere weeks ago that’s now worth more than $1 billion, is making gigantic fortunes for those undeterred by warnings this is a fad that will end badly.A perfect example: a pseudonymous trader named dimethyltryptamine.eth spent $263 just three weeks ago to buy trillions of PEPE tokens.

That former pittance has turned into $3.8 million in profits from tokens they’ve already sold, and their remaining holdings are worth about $9 million, according to data by blockchain research firm Arkham Intelligence.

That’s an almost 5,000,000% profit.The trader is benefitting from the breakneck rally of a coin based on the “pepe the frog” meme, a popular symbol in crypto circles.

Launched in April, the meme coin’s market capitalization astonishingly surpassed $1 billion on Friday and, according to CoinGecko, at one point was worth more than Arbitrum’s ARB, which is also among the hottest newly issued tokens of 2023.Analysts, however, have raised concerns about the concentrated ownership of pepecoin, pointing to a handful of traders acquiring substantial amounts of PEPE when the token was released last month.

Blockchain sleuth Lookonchain unveiled five accounts connected to a wallet belonging to pepecexwallet.eth, which received funds directly from the token’s deployer contract, acquired over 8.87 trillion PEPE after issuance for just $385.Dimethyltryptamine.eth, which wasn’t cited among the insider wallets by Lookonchain but belongs among the earliest buyers, purchased 5.907 trillion of PEPE tokens for $263 in two transactions on April 14 using UniSwap, Arkham shows.

The trader also paid $17 for gas fees.Since then, the trader has been gradually taking profits by sending smaller amounts multiple times a day to UniSwap, and receiving ether (ETH) in exchange.

The wallet has sent $3.8 million of PEPE to UniSwap in the past month, per Arkham data, presumably to take profits, with $2.4 million of that transferred in the past 24 hours.Pepecoin trader has been taking profits.

He holds BTC and ETH.Follow @sndr_krisztian on TwitterThe bewilderingly fast rise of pepecoin (PEPE), a meme coin introduced mere weeks ago that’s now worth more than $1 billion, is making gigantic fortunes for those undeterred by warnings this is a fad that will end badly.A perfect example: a pseudonymous trader named dimethyltryptamine.eth spent $263 just three weeks ago to buy trillions of PEPE tokens.

That former pittance has turned into $3.8 million in profits from tokens they’ve already sold, and their remaining holdings are worth about $9 million, according to data by blockchain research firm Arkham Intelligence.

That’s an almost 5,000,000% profit.The trader is benefitting from the breakneck rally of a coin based on the “pepe the frog” meme, a popular symbol in crypto circles.

Launched in April, the meme coin’s market capitalization astonishingly surpassed $1 billion on Friday and, according to CoinGecko, at one point was worth more than Arbitrum’s ARB, which is also among the hottest newly issued tokens of 2023.Analysts, however, have raised concerns about the concentrated ownership of pepecoin, pointing to a handful of traders acquiring substantial amounts of PEPE when the token was released last month.

Blockchain sleuth Lookonchain unveiled five accounts connected to a wallet belonging to pepecexwallet.eth, which received funds directly from the token’s deployer contract, acquired over 8.87 trillion PEPE after issuance for just $385.Dimethyltryptamine.eth, which wasn’t cited among the insider wallets by Lookonchain but belongs among the earliest buyers, purchased 5.907 trillion of PEPE tokens for $263 in two transactions on April 14 using UniSwap, Arkham shows.

The trader also paid $17 for gas fees.Since then, the trader has been gradually taking profits by sending smaller amounts multiple times a day to UniSwap, and receiving ether (ETH) in exchange.

The wallet has sent $3.8 million of PEPE to UniSwap in the past month, per Arkham data, presumably to take profits, with $2.4 million of that transferred in the past 24 hours.Pepecoin trader has been taking profits.

A Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) rival that made its debut last month is skyrocketing to new all-time highs after being listed by Binance.

In a new announcement, the world’s largest crypto exchange platform by volume says that it will be adding support for Pepe (PEPE), sparking a massive rally in the memecoin, as well as dog-themed crypto asset Floki (FLOKI).

According to Binance, the meme tokens will be listed in the Innovation Zone, a place dedicated to trading new tokens that tend to be volatile and pose risks for investors.

News of the listing sent Pepe flying as it went from its all-time low of $0.000000254 on April 28th to its current price of $0.00000375, a staggering 1,300% gain.

During the last 24 hours alone, Pepe has seen an increase of over 120%.

The asset is based on a controversial meme.

According to Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao, even though memecoins are high-risk assets and he personally doesn’t understand them, the crypto exchange will continue to support them as they tend to have large user bases.

Remember, no one is forcing you to buy them.

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Rival That’s Exploded Over 1,300% in a Week Hits New All-Time High After Binance Listing by Mehron Rokhy May 5, 2023 in Altcoins, Trading A Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) rival that made its debut last month is skyrocketing to new all-time highs after being listed by Binance.

In a new announcement, the world’s largest crypto exchange platform by volume says that it will be adding support for Pepe (PEPE), sparking a massive rally in the memecoin, as well as dog-themed crypto asset Floki (FLOKI).

According to Binance, the meme tokens will be listed in the Innovation Zone, a place dedicated to trading new tokens that tend to be volatile and pose risks for investors.

News of the listing sent Pepe flying as it went from its all-time low of $0.000000254 on April 28th to its current price of $0.00000375, a staggering 1,300% gain.

During the last 24 hours alone, Pepe has seen an increase of over 120%.

The asset is based on a controversial meme.

According to Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao, even though memecoins are high-risk assets and he personally doesn’t understand them, the crypto exchange will continue to support them as they tend to have large user bases.

Most of the coins have come back to the green zone, according to the CoinMarketCap ranking.

The rate of SHIB has followed the bounce back of other coins, rising by 0.41%.

On the hourly time frame, the rate of SHIB has begun to sharply rise after a false breakout of the local support level at $0.00000984.

If the growth can continue to the resistance, there is a chance to see a blast to the $0.00001010 zone tomorrow.

On the daily chart, the situation is less positive as the rate keeps trading near the support at $0.00000965.

If sellers' pressure continues and the bar closes below the $0.00000980 mark, the breakout may lead to a more profound drop to the $0.000009 area within the next few days.

The weekly time frame is similar to the daily one as the price is slowly approaching the support.

If buyers cannot seize the initiative shortly and the bar closes below the previous candle low at $0.00000972, there is a high chance to see a fall to the $0.000008-$0.000009 zone by the end of the month.

SHIB is trading at $0.00000992 at press time.

If buyers cannot seize the initiative shortly and the bar closes below the previous candle low at $0.00000972, there is a high chance to see a fall to the $0.000008-$0.000009 zone by the end of the month.

The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to the frequent introduction of new digital tokens, with meme coins such as Dogecoin DOGE/USD and Shiba Inu SHIB/USD gaining prominence.

PEPE PEPE/USD, a newly launched meme coin, has quickly captured attention and been listed on multiple exchanges, despite questions about its credibility due to its novelty.

Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, recently announced the addition of PEPE to its platform, potentially shifting perceptions about the coin's credibility.

Floki Inu FLOKI/USD, another well-known meme coin, will also be listed alongside PEPE.

Notably, both coins will be featured in Binance's Innovation Zone.

The Innovation Zone is a specialized trading area where users can trade newly introduced and potentially volatile tokens, which may carry higher risks than other tokens.

PEPE and FLOKI are set to be listed on Binance starting from May 5, 2023, at 16:00 [UTC].

While trading has yet to begin, users can deposit funds in preparation.

The trading pairs for PEPE are PEPE/USDT and PEPE/TUSD.

Additionally, Binance plans to add FLOKI and PEPE as new assets eligible for borrowing through Isolated Margins, with new margin pairs available within 48 hours.

Despite these positive developments for the nascent meme coin, the exchange asserts that PEPE has no utility.

PEPE's Market Cap Reaches $1B: Following the announcement of Binance's listing, PEPE's market cap experienced a notable increase.

At the time of writing, the asset's market cap stood at around $1,264,145,312.

Concurrently, the price of PEPE rose to $0.00000285 after a 75.8% daily increase, even reaching an all-time high of $0.00000302 earlier.

This upward trend may continue as more exchanges are likely to list PEPE now that Binance has taken the lead.

Metacade (MCADE) is one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the world, having jumped by more than 275% from its all-time low since going public in April this year.

This impressive performance is not only due to the cryptocurrency market’s general bullishness but also three main reasons why the Metacade price will likely continue to soar in the near term.

First, macro events favor cryptocurrencies and other assets.

The Federal Reserve’s decision to hike interest rates by 0.25% brought them to about 5.25%.

Analysts believe that the Fed has now ended its hiking cycle since there are signs that the American economy is slowing.

Furthermore, the banking sector is at its biggest risk in years, with some banks collapsing.

Therefore, it is likely that Metacade will and other altcoins will do well because of Bitcoin’s role as a haven.

Second, important news could push the token higher.

The number of MCADE holders has continued to rise in the past few weeks, and the token is gaining traction.

Additionally, the developers are working to get the token listed in more centralized exchanges, with Binance and OKX among the potential listings.

The developers are also working on the Metacade game, which is expected to be launched soon.

Historically, crypto tokens tend to do well ahead of a major event.

Third, the technicals are supportive.

On the four-hour chart, Metacade’s price has been bullish in the past few weeks, moving above the important resistance point at $0.034, the highest point on April 20th.

It has now retested that price in what is known as a break and retest pattern, supported by the 50-period moving average.

Therefore, the token will bounce back as buyers target the all-time high of $0.045.

In conclusion, Metacade (MCADE) is a cryptocurrency that has shown impressive growth potential, and there are three main reasons why its price will likely continue to soar in the near term.

First, macro events favor cryptocurrencies and other assets.

Second, there is important news that could push the token higher.

And third, the technicals are supportive.

Therefore, investing in Metacade may be smart for investors looking to add a potentially high-performing cryptocurrency to their portfolio.

share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Whatsapp Share via Email Metacade (MCADE) is one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the world, having jumped by more than 275% from its all-time low since going public in April this year.

This impressive performance is not only due to the cryptocurrency market’s general bullishness but also three main reasons why the Metacade price will likely continue to soar in the near term.

First, macro events favor cryptocurrencies and other assets.

The Federal Reserve’s decision to hike interest rates by 0.25% brought them to about 5.25%.

Analysts believe that the Fed has now ended its hiking cycle since there are signs that the American economy is slowing.

Furthermore, the banking sector is at its biggest risk in years, with some banks collapsing.

Therefore, it is likely that Metacade will and other altcoins will do well because of Bitcoin’s role as a haven.

Second, important news could push the token higher.

The number of MCADE holders has continued to rise in the past few weeks, and the token is gaining traction.

Additionally, the developers are working to get the token listed in more centralized exchanges, with Binance and OKX among the potential listings.

The developers are also working on the Metacade game, which is expected to be launched soon.

Historically, crypto tokens tend to do well ahead of a major event.

Third, the technicals are supportive.

On the four-hour chart, Metacade’s price has been bullish in the past few weeks, moving above the important resistance point at $0.034, the highest point on April 20th.

It has now retested that price in what is known as a break and retest pattern, supported by the 50-period moving average.

Therefore, the token will bounce back as buyers target the all-time high of $0.045.

In conclusion, Metacade (MCADE) is a cryptocurrency that has shown impressive growth potential, and there are three main reasons why its price will likely continue to soar in the near term.

First, macro events favor cryptocurrencies and other assets.

Second, there is important news that could push the token higher.

And third, the technicals are supportive.

Therefore, investing in Metacade may be smart for investors looking to add a potentially high-performing cryptocurrency to their portfolio.

DOT has been on a downward spiral recently.

However, a price reversal looks likely with bulls attempting a recovery of its YTD high.

Polkadot [DOT] began the year on a bullish note, posting gains of 84.7% to reach a YTD high of $7.9, as of 19 February.

Since then, the price has almost wiped off those gains, with sellers dominating the market.

However, as of press time, Bitcoin’s [BTC] close above $29k could kickstart a substantial recovery for DOT.

DOT has been on a steep downward trend since 18 April.

Price smashed through the $6.4 support level before bulls found some respite at the $5.7 support level.

However, this didn’t last long as sellers broke past the $5.7 support on 1 May.

On the daily timeframe, sellers have maintained the pressure with price trading under the $5.7 area for three days.

While the overall structure for DOT remained bearish, a few signals point to a bullish pullback on the horizon.

On the four-hour chart, DOT posted three bullish candles in a row, causing the RSI to climb above the neutral 50 mark.

The OBV also rose by 1.73 million.

A near-term recovery plan for bulls will involve a daily candle close above the $5.7 resistance level.

This could spur a push to reclaim the $6.4 level.

On the flip side, bears could continue the downward push with the $5 psychological support level as the next target.

Coinalyze‘s data showed a significant rise in funding rates over the past 72 hours.

As of the time of writing, funding rates remained positive–a bullish sentiment that meant demand was picking up.

This could serve as a signal for a bullish recovery.

Additionally, the long/short ratio for DOT saw buy positions with a 52.5% advantage over sell positions at 47.5% in the past four-hour period.

Traders can look out for a daily close above $5.7 for long positions.

Polkadot [DOT] began the year on a bullish note, posting gains of 84.7% to reach a YTD high of $7.9, as of 19 February.

Since then, the price has almost wiped off those gains, with sellers dominating the market.

Selling pressure has been relentless with no pushback from bulls Source: DOT/USDT on Trading View DOT has been on a steep downward trend since 18 April.

Price smashed through the $6.4 support level before bulls found some respite at the $5.7 support level.

However, this didn’t last long as sellers broke past the $5.7 support on 1 May.

On the daily timeframe, sellers have maintained the pressure with price trading under the $5.7 area for three days.

While the overall structure for DOT remained bearish, a few signals point to a bullish pullback on the horizon.

On the four-hour chart, DOT posted three bullish candles in a row, causing the RSI to climb above the neutral 50 mark.

The OBV also rose by 1.73 million.

A near-term recovery plan for bulls will involve a daily candle close above the $5.7 resistance level.

This could spur a push to reclaim the $6.4 level.

On the flip side, bears could continue the downward push with the $5 psychological support level as the next target.

The former Terraform Labs CEO could face 40 years in jail in South Korea, the country where he committed most of his crimes, according to local authorities.

South Korean authorities are seeking the extradition of the co-founder and former CEO of Terraform Labs, Do Kwon.

The prosecutor overseeing the investigation believes his repatriation would best serve the victims of the TerraUSD (USTC) and LUNA token collapses, The Wall Street Journal reported.

South Korea is the place where most of the crimes Kwon is accused of took place, according to Dan Sung-han, leader of the South Korean prosecutors investigating the crash of the two cryptocurrencies, which erased nearly $40 billion from the Terra ecosystem.

Kwon, also a South Korean citizen, was arrested in Montenegro in March and indicted on document forgery charges.

Since then, authorities from the United States and South Korea have made efforts to extradite the Terra co-founder.

He is also wanted by regulatory authorities in Singapore.

During a press conference after Kwon’s arrest, Montenegrin Justice Minister Marko Kovač said that a decision on his extradition would be based on “several factors," including the severity of the criminal offense as well as the location and time of the offense.

Montenegro reportedly has no extradition treaty with either Singapore or South Korea.

However, it has an old extradition agreement with the U.S.

and has previously extradited American citizens.

In late April, South Korean officials indicted Shin Hyun-seong, also a co-founder of Terraform Labs, along with nine other individuals for the collapse of the Terra ecosystem on charges of fraud, breach of trust and embezzlement.

Prosecutors accused the individuals of earning illicit profits of nearly 460 billion Korean won ($350 million), the Korean daily KBS World reported.

Kwon would face similar charges if extradited to his home country, Sung-han told the Journal, with a jail term of up to 40 years.

Terra was one of the earliest crypto firms that popularized the concept of algorithmic stablecoins.

The ecosystem collapsed when its native stablecoin, USTC, depegged from the U.S.

dollar in May 2022, triggering a snowball crisis in the crypto industry last year.

The prosecutor overseeing the investigation believes his repatriation would best serve the victims of the TerraUSD (USTC) and LUNA token collapses, The Wall Street Journal reported.

South Korea is the place where most of the crimes Kwon is accused of took place, according to Dan Sung-han, leader of the South Korean prosecutors investigating the crash of the two cryptocurrencies, which erased nearly $40 billion from the Terra ecosystem.

Given the nature of this incident, we think investigating the case in South Korea would be the most efficient way of bringing justice [to investors]”, the prosecutor said in an interview with the newspaper.

Kwon, also a South Korean citizen, was arrested in Montenegro in March and indicted on document forgery charges.

Since then, authorities from the United States and South Korea have made efforts to extradite the Terra co-founder.

He is also wanted by regulatory authorities in Singapore.Related: Terraform Labs seeks to dismiss class action arguing US laws don’t applyDuring a press conference after Kwon’s arrest, Montenegrin Justice Minister Marko Kovač said that a decision on his extradition would be based on “several factors," including the severity of the criminal offense as well as the location and time of the offense.

Montenegro reportedly has no extradition treaty with either Singapore or South Korea.

However, it has an old extradition agreement with the U.S.

and has previously extradited American citizens.In late April, South Korean officials indicted Shin Hyun-seong, also a co-founder of Terraform Labs, along with nine other individuals for the collapse of the Terra ecosystem on charges of fraud, breach of trust and embezzlement.

Prosecutors accused the individuals of earning illicit profits of nearly 460 billion Korean won ($350 million), the Korean daily KBS World reported.

Kwon would face similar charges if extradited to his home country, Sung-han told the Journal, with a jail term of up to 40 years.

Terra was one of the earliest crypto firms that popularized the concept of algorithmic stablecoins.

The ecosystem collapsed when its native stablecoin, USTC, depegged from the U.S.

dollar in May 2022, triggering a snowball crisis in the crypto industry last year.

Michael Saylor – the man behind software giant MicroStrategy and a major crypto bull – has paid off a $200 million+ loan obtained from the now failed crypto bank Silvergate and has purchased even more bitcoin units, thus bringing the company’s total BTC holdings to nearly $4 billion.

On the one hand, this is a positive story.

Saylor and MicroStrategy were literally billions of dollars in debt in 2022 thanks to the ongoing bear run.

The price of bitcoin was hit extremely hard and wound up losing more than 70 percent of its value over the course of 12 short months, falling from its new all-time high of $68,000 per unit (achieved in November of 2021) and dipping into the mid-$16K range by the end of 2022.

It was a sad and ugly sight to see.

Institutional players like MicroStrategy suffered greatly.

The bitcoin-related decisions made by Saylor led to his official step down from the CEO position he had held with the company for over 30 years, and he switched over to the role of executive chairman.

The fact that the company has managed to pull itself out of the doldrums and ultimately pay off one of its biggest loans is a good sign that things are perhaps picking up not just for the enterprise, but for the digital currency space.

However, as we’ve seen by now, Saylor’s love of BTC has gone a little overboard at times, and he arguably rushes into things without really thinking about them as much as he should.

Right now, BTC and its altcoin cousins are enduring a bit of a bull run, a solid change from 2022.

It’s nice to sit back and watch, though it would be incorrect to assume that we’re fully out of the darkness and there isn’t more space to improve and heal.

The fact remains that BTC is nowhere near where it was a year and a half ago, and the idea that Saylor would simply jump all the way back into the bitcoin bin without allowing more time to go by is a bit concerning.

It suggests that he hasn’t really learned his lesson from the past yet, and thus MicroStrategy could be in for more pain before it’s able to fully remove the bandages from its former wounds.

MicroStrategy repaid its $205M Silvergate loan at a 22 percent discount.

Silvergate was one of several banks to crumble and collapse in recent weeks, with others being Silicon Valley and Signature.

The financial catastrophe has also spread to Europe, with institutions such as Credit Suisse being on the verge of crashing and burning before it was saved by a $3 billion-bearing UBS.

Earn Your First Bitcoin Sign up and get $12 Bonus Referral bonus up to $3,000 Sign up Michael Saylor – the man behind software giant MicroStrategy and a major crypto bull – has paid off a $200 million+ loan obtained from the now failed crypto bank Silvergate and has purchased even more bitcoin units, thus bringing the company’s total BTC holdings to nearly $4 billion.

Michael Saylor Won’t Give Up on BTC On the one hand, this is a positive story.

Saylor and MicroStrategy were literally billions of dollars in debt in 2022 thanks to the ongoing bear run.

The price of bitcoin was hit extremely hard and wound up losing more than 70 percent of its value over the course of 12 short months, falling from its new all-time high of $68,000 per unit (achieved in November of 2021) and dipping into the mid-$16K range by the end of 2022.

It was a sad and ugly sight to see.

Institutional players like MicroStrategy suffered greatly.

The bitcoin-related decisions made by Saylor led to his official step down from the CEO position he had held with the company for over 30 years, and he switched over to the role of executive chairman.

The fact that the company has managed to pull itself out of the doldrums and ultimately pay off one of its biggest loans is a good sign that things are perhaps picking up not just for the enterprise, but for the digital currency space.

However, as we’ve seen by now, Saylor’s love of BTC has gone a little overboard at times, and he arguably rushes into things without really thinking about them as much as he should.

Right now, BTC and its altcoin cousins are enduring a bit of a bull run, a solid change from 2022.

It’s nice to sit back and watch, though it would be incorrect to assume that we’re fully out of the darkness and there isn’t more space to improve and heal.

The fact remains that BTC is nowhere near where it was a year and a half ago, and the idea that Saylor would simply jump all the way back into the bitcoin bin without allowing more time to go by is a bit concerning.

It suggests that he hasn’t really learned his lesson from the past yet, and thus MicroStrategy could be in for more pain before it’s able to fully remove the bandages from its former wounds.

In late March, Saylor issued the following statement on Twitter: MicroStrategy repaid its $205M Silvergate loan at a 22 percent discount.

So Many Banks Are Collapsing Silvergate was one of several banks to crumble and collapse in recent weeks, with others being Silicon Valley and Signature.

The financial catastrophe has also spread to Europe, with institutions such as Credit Suisse being on the verge of crashing and burning before it was saved by a $3 billion-bearing UBS.

The Cardano roadmap is a five-era plan for the development of Cardano, which is currently in the Basho era and focused on improving scalability and interoperability.

Over the years, the Cardano Roadmap has undergone significant transformations.

The network was the first to be labeled the “Ethereum Killer,” and since then, its development has progressed tremendously.

The latest development in the Cardano Roadmap is the Valentine upgrade, which is a crucial milestone in the network’s journey.

It brings new capabilities and advancements to the network, and it’s essential to understand where it falls in the roadmap’s era.

The Cardano roadmap outlined the development of Cardano, which has been divided into five distinct eras: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire.

The first era, Byron, was named after Lord Byron and was a critical phase in the network’s development.

During this era, the foundational architecture of the network was established, including integrating the Daedalus wallet into the Cardano ecosystem.

Additionally, the network welcomed the Yoroi light wallet, developed by IOHK’s sister company, Emurgo.

The Shelley era was a crucial milestone in the Cardano roadmap, as it established a higher degree of decentralization.

With the mainnet launch, the Cardano ecosystem shifted from the federated Byron era toward a more community-run node system.

During this phase, the network introduced the Mary upgrade.

It allowed users to create their tokens on top of the Cardano network, opening up new possibilities for decentralized applications.

The Goguen era was another significant milestone for Cardano.

It brought smart contracts to the platform and allowed for the development of decentralized applications using the Plutus language.

Additionally, the network implemented a multi-currency ledger to support the creation of new tokens natively.

To make smart contract creation more accessible to non-programmers, Cardano introduced Marlowe.

It was a supplementary programming language that allowed for the easy creation and testing of smart contracts.

The Basho era marked Cardano’s fourth stage of blockchain improvements, focused on maximizing scalability and interoperability.

One of the key features of this phase was the implementation of sidechains that was compatible with the Cardano mainnet.

These sidechains allow for the transfer of heavy loads from the public network.

In addition, the Basho era would see the development of new account models.

Although the main network would continue to use the UTXO model.

The Voltaire era is the final stage in the Cardano roadmap and will introduce a shift in the network’s governance.

It will allow users to submit improvement proposals that stakeholders in the community can vote on.

This new voting mechanism will ensure that the future development of the network is in the hands of its participants.

It will give validators the ability to use their ADA holdings and voting rights to influence the direction of future development.

Furthermore, the Voltaire era would introduce a treasury that would take a fraction of all transaction fees for future development.

The Valentine upgrade was a recent addition to Cardano’s Goguen era, which aimed to expand the platform’s capabilities by enabling the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that could run on the network.

Specifically, the Valentine upgrade helps developers create software that uses smart contracts and extends the compatibility of Cardano with other blockchains.

By adding support for the SECP256k1 curve, the upgrade improved compatibility between Cardano and other leading blockchains.

The Valentine upgrade also introduced two additional signature types, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr, which can be used by people and firms creating dApps on Cardano to verify data.

These improvements will enable developers to build more sophisticated and secure applications on the Cardano network.

It’s worth noting that, as of May 2023, Cardano was currently in the Basho era, which was focused on improving the platform’s scalability and interoperability.

The implementation of sharding and the integration of sidechains are key priorities for the network in this phase.

The Cardano network has seen a significant uptick in Dapps and liquidity flow since the activation of smart contract capability and the development of Dapps in the Goguen era of the Cardano roadmap.

According to DefiLlama data, the Total Value Locked (TVL) of the Cardano network as of this writing was approximately $154.12 million.

While an uptrend could be noticed on the chart, the TVL was significantly lower than Ethereum, which had over $28 billion locked in its network.

However, the Cardano network had been leading the charge in terms of development activity over the past 30 days, according to data from Santiment.

Only Polkadot and Kusama were ahead of Cardano in terms of commitment.

This indicated that despite lagging in TVL, Cardano was making strides in its development efforts.

Although ADA’s price appeared to be underwhelming recently, the coin experienced significant growth throughout the year.

Based on a daily timeframe chart analysis, ADA’s value has increased by over 60% since the beginning of the year.

As of this writing, the coin was trading at approximately $0.3 with only a slight gain of less than 1%.

The recent dip in value had caused the coin to drop below the neutral line on the Relative Strength Index.

The Cardano Roadmap has undergone significant transformations, from establishing the foundational architecture during the Byron era to introduce smart contracts during the Goguen era.

The Valentine upgrade was a crucial milestone in the Goguen era, expanding the platform’s capabilities for creating decentralized applications and improving compatibility with other blockchains.

As Cardano continues its journey through the Basho era, we can expect further improvements.

May 5, 2023 Suzuki Shillsalot contributor Suzuki Shillsalot contributor May 5, 2023 Share this article Share Tweet Cardano’s development has progressed through five eras: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire.

The Valentine Upgrade was a recent addition to Cardano’s Goguen era that aimed to expand the platform’s capabilities by enabling the creation of dApps.

Over the years, the Cardano Roadmap has undergone significant transformations.

The network was the first to be labeled the “Ethereum Killer,” and since then, its development has progressed tremendously.

Read Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2023-24 The latest development in the Cardano Roadmap is the Valentine upgrade, which is a crucial milestone in the network’s journey.

It brings new capabilities and advancements to the network, and it’s essential to understand where it falls in the roadmap’s era.

Understanding the Cardano Roadmap The Cardano roadmap outlined the development of Cardano, which has been divided into five distinct eras: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire.

The first era, Byron, was named after Lord Byron and was a critical phase in the network’s development.

During this era, the foundational architecture of the network was established, including integrating the Daedalus wallet into the Cardano ecosystem.

Additionally, the network welcomed the Yoroi light wallet, developed by IOHK’s sister company, Emurgo.

The Shelley era was a crucial milestone in the Cardano roadmap, as it established a higher degree of decentralization.

With the mainnet launch, the Cardano ecosystem shifted from the federated Byron era toward a more community-run node system.

During this phase, the network introduced the Mary upgrade.

It allowed users to create their tokens on top of the Cardano network, opening up new possibilities for decentralized applications.

The Goguen era was another significant milestone for Cardano.

It brought smart contracts to the platform and allowed for the development of decentralized applications using the Plutus language.

Additionally, the network implemented a multi-currency ledger to support the creation of new tokens natively.

To make smart contract creation more accessible to non-programmers, Cardano introduced Marlowe.

It was a supplementary programming language that allowed for the easy creation and testing of smart contracts.

The current stage and future of the Cardano roadmap The Basho era marked Cardano’s fourth stage of blockchain improvements, focused on maximizing scalability and interoperability.

One of the key features of this phase was the implementation of sidechains that was compatible with the Cardano mainnet.

These sidechains allow for the transfer of heavy loads from the public network.

In addition, the Basho era would see the development of new account models.

Although the main network would continue to use the UTXO model.

The Voltaire era is the final stage in the Cardano roadmap and will introduce a shift in the network’s governance.

It will allow users to submit improvement proposals that stakeholders in the community can vote on.

This new voting mechanism will ensure that the future development of the network is in the hands of its participants.

It will give validators the ability to use their ADA holdings and voting rights to influence the direction of future development.

Furthermore, the Voltaire era would introduce a treasury that would take a fraction of all transaction fees for future development.

Where does Valentine fall on the Cardano roadmap?

The Valentine upgrade was a recent addition to Cardano’s Goguen era, which aimed to expand the platform’s capabilities by enabling the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that could run on the network.

Specifically, the Valentine upgrade helps developers create software that uses smart contracts and extends the compatibility of Cardano with other blockchains.

By adding support for the SECP256k1 curve, the upgrade improved compatibility between Cardano and other leading blockchains.

The Valentine upgrade also introduced two additional signature types, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr, which can be used by people and firms creating dApps on Cardano to verify data.

These improvements will enable developers to build more sophisticated and secure applications on the Cardano network.

It’s worth noting that, as of May 2023, Cardano was currently in the Basho era, which was focused on improving the platform’s scalability and interoperability.

The implementation of sharding and the integration of sidechains are key priorities for the network in this phase.

The Cardano TVL and dev activity The Cardano network has seen a significant uptick in Dapps and liquidity flow since the activation of smart contract capability and the development of Dapps in the Goguen era of the Cardano roadmap.

According to DefiLlama data, the Total Value Locked (TVL) of the Cardano network as of this writing was approximately $154.12 million.

While an uptrend could be noticed on the chart, the TVL was significantly lower than Ethereum, which had over $28 billion locked in its network.

However, the Cardano network had been leading the charge in terms of development activity over the past 30 days, according to data from Santiment.

Only Polkadot and Kusama were ahead of Cardano in terms of commitment.

This indicated that despite lagging in TVL, Cardano was making strides in its development efforts.

Based on a daily timeframe chart analysis, ADA’s value has increased by over 60% since the beginning of the year.

As of this writing, the coin was trading at approximately $0.3 with only a slight gain of less than 1%.

The recent dip in value had caused the coin to drop below the neutral line on the Relative Strength Index.

The Cardano Roadmap has undergone significant transformations, from establishing the foundational architecture during the Byron era to introduce smart contracts during the Goguen era.

The Valentine upgrade was a crucial milestone in the Goguen era, expanding the platform’s capabilities for creating decentralized applications and improving compatibility with other blockchains.

While Cardano’s TVL may lag behind Ethereum, the network was making strides in its development efforts.

As Cardano continues its journey through the Basho era, we can expect further improvements.

The Cardano Roadmap has undergone significant transformations, from establishing the foundational architecture during the Byron era to introduce smart contracts during the Goguen era.

The Valentine upgrade was a crucial milestone in the Goguen era, expanding the platform’s capabilities for creating decentralized applications and improving compatibility with other blockchains.

While Cardano’s TVL may lag behind Ethereum, the network was making strides in its development efforts.

As Cardano continues its journey through the Basho era, we can expect further improvements.

5min Read The Cardano roadmap is a five-era plan for the development of Cardano, which is currently in the Basho era and focused on improving scalability and interoperability.

Suzuki Shillsalot contributor May 5, 2023 Share this article Share Tweet Cardano’s development has progressed through five eras: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire.

The Valentine Upgrade was a recent addition to Cardano’s Goguen era that aimed to expand the platform’s capabilities by enabling the creation of dApps.

Over the years, the Cardano Roadmap has undergone significant transformations.

The network was the first to be labeled the “Ethereum Killer,” and since then, its development has progressed tremendously.

Read Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2023-24 The latest development in the Cardano Roadmap is the Valentine upgrade, which is a crucial milestone in the network’s journey.

It brings new capabilities and advancements to the network, and it’s essential to understand where it falls in the roadmap’s era.

Understanding the Cardano Roadmap The Cardano roadmap outlined the development of Cardano, which has been divided into five distinct eras: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire.

The first era, Byron, was named after Lord Byron and was a critical phase in the network’s development.

During this era, the foundational architecture of the network was established, including integrating the Daedalus wallet into the Cardano ecosystem.

Additionally, the network welcomed the Yoroi light wallet, developed by IOHK’s sister company, Emurgo.

The Shelley era was a crucial milestone in the Cardano roadmap, as it established a higher degree of decentralization.

With the mainnet launch, the Cardano ecosystem shifted from the federated Byron era toward a more community-run node system.

During this phase, the network introduced the Mary upgrade.

It allowed users to create their tokens on top of the Cardano network, opening up new possibilities for decentralized applications.

The Goguen era was another significant milestone for Cardano.

It brought smart contracts to the platform and allowed for the development of decentralized applications using the Plutus language.

Additionally, the network implemented a multi-currency ledger to support the creation of new tokens natively.

To make smart contract creation more accessible to non-programmers, Cardano introduced Marlowe.

It was a supplementary programming language that allowed for the easy creation and testing of smart contracts.

The current stage and future of the Cardano roadmap The Basho era marked Cardano’s fourth stage of blockchain improvements, focused on maximizing scalability and interoperability.

One of the key features of this phase was the implementation of sidechains that was compatible with the Cardano mainnet.

These sidechains allow for the transfer of heavy loads from the public network.

In addition, the Basho era would see the development of new account models.

Although the main network would continue to use the UTXO model.

The Voltaire era is the final stage in the Cardano roadmap and will introduce a shift in the network’s governance.

It will allow users to submit improvement proposals that stakeholders in the community can vote on.

This new voting mechanism will ensure that the future development of the network is in the hands of its participants.

It will give validators the ability to use their ADA holdings and voting rights to influence the direction of future development.

Furthermore, the Voltaire era would introduce a treasury that would take a fraction of all transaction fees for future development.

Where does Valentine fall on the Cardano roadmap?

The Valentine upgrade was a recent addition to Cardano’s Goguen era, which aimed to expand the platform’s capabilities by enabling the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that could run on the network.

Specifically, the Valentine upgrade helps developers create software that uses smart contracts and extends the compatibility of Cardano with other blockchains.

By adding support for the SECP256k1 curve, the upgrade improved compatibility between Cardano and other leading blockchains.

The Valentine upgrade also introduced two additional signature types, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Schnorr, which can be used by people and firms creating dApps on Cardano to verify data.

These improvements will enable developers to build more sophisticated and secure applications on the Cardano network.

It’s worth noting that, as of May 2023, Cardano was currently in the Basho era, which was focused on improving the platform’s scalability and interoperability.

The implementation of sharding and the integration of sidechains are key priorities for the network in this phase.

The Cardano TVL and dev activity The Cardano network has seen a significant uptick in Dapps and liquidity flow since the activation of smart contract capability and the development of Dapps in the Goguen era of the Cardano roadmap.

According to DefiLlama data, the Total Value Locked (TVL) of the Cardano network as of this writing was approximately $154.12 million.

While an uptrend could be noticed on the chart, the TVL was significantly lower than Ethereum, which had over $28 billion locked in its network.

However, the Cardano network had been leading the charge in terms of development activity over the past 30 days, according to data from Santiment.

Only Polkadot and Kusama were ahead of Cardano in terms of commitment.

This indicated that despite lagging in TVL, Cardano was making strides in its development efforts.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been showing signs of maturation in recent weeks, distinguishing itself from the more volatile meme coins that have been dominating headlines.

While meme assets like Pepe (PEPE) have been pushed to meteoric heights by small retail investors, SHIB's performance has been remarkably steady, moving within the same price range for the past two weeks.

This stability suggests that SHIB may no longer be considered a meme coin and is increasingly following broader crypto market trends.

There are several factors contributing to this shift in perception.

First, SHIB's development team has been working diligently to expand the project's ecosystem and utility.

With the launch of ShibaSwap, the project's decentralized exchange, and the release of SHIB's Layer 2 solution, the team has demonstrated its commitment to long-term growth and sustainability.

Secondly, SHIB's growing community of supporters and investors has helped to establish it as a more stable and credible asset.

The adoption of SHIB by major exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, has further legitimized the token in the eyes of the wider crypto community.

As a result, the market's perception of SHIB has shifted from its being a speculative meme coin to a more mature digital asset.

The Pepe (PEPE) token has been on a remarkable rally in recent days, adding another 150% to its value in just 48 hours.

This impressive surge comes after the meme coin had already experienced a staggering 7,500x increase in value.

As a result, PEPE's market capitalization is now rapidly approaching the $1 billion mark, placing it among the top 10 meme assets in the cryptocurrency space.

This seemingly unstoppable growth raises the question: is the current PEPE rally a sign of genuine investor euphoria, or is it a bullish trap waiting to snare unsuspecting traders?

To answer this, it is important to examine the factors driving the token's performance and assess the potential risks involved.

One possible explanation for PEPE's meteoric rise is the growing popularity of meme coins on the cryptocurrency market.

The success of tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) has demonstrated that there is a significant appetite for meme-based assets among investors.

This enthusiasm has the potential to drive PEPE's price higher as more traders seek to capitalize on the trend.

XRP has been hovering around the $0.46 price level for the past few weeks.

This price point aligns with the 50-day moving average, which has remained relatively flat for over two weeks.

The dramatic decrease in volatility may suggest that XRP is poised for a significant bounce in the near future, particularly when considering the notable drop in trading volume.

The extended period of low volatility is indicative of market consolidation, as traders and investors are waiting for a catalyst to trigger the next significant price movement.

When markets experience prolonged periods of consolidation, it often leads to a spike in volatility once momentum shifts.

In XRP's case, the dramatic decrease in trading volume adds further evidence that the market is coiling, and a substantial move is imminent.

Several factors could serve as a catalyst for XRP's potential bounce.

Ripple's ongoing legal battle with the U.S.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may come to an end in 2023.

A favorable outcome for Ripple in this case could provide a significant boost to XRP's price, as it would alleviate regulatory uncertainty surrounding the token.

Additionally, the overall sentiment on the cryptocurrency market can play a crucial role in XRP's price trajectory.

As investors regain confidence and the market recovers from recent setbacks, there is potential for a ripple effect, pun intended, that could benefit XRP and other major cryptocurrencies.

Cointelegraph analyst and writer Marcel Pechman explains how PacWest’s plummeting share price and the continued banking crisis could impact Bitcoin.

Macro Markets, hosted by crypto analyst Marcel Pechman, airs every Friday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel and explains complex concepts in layperson’s terms, focusing on the cause and effect of traditional financial events on day-to-day crypto activity.

PacWest Bancorp’s 50% price decline and the ongoing banking crisis are the first topics of this week’s show.

The bank holds $40 billion in assets, although 80% of its lending portfolio has been assigned to commercial real estate loans and residential mortgages. The issue?

As usual, rising interest rates.

Meanwhile, the total underwater bond position of United States banks is $600 billion, not including derivatives.

However, the U.S.

Treasury has been bailing out every one of the latest three bankruptcies: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank and First Republic.

SVB’s losses are estimated at $20 billion, or 15% of the total Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) capacity.

Pechman explains how Bitcoin’s (BTC) price should react in case PacWest Bancorp fails and why gold has recently flirted with its all-time high above $2,050.

More importantly, how the banking crisis impacts government debt, which is spiraling out of control — consequently, extremely positive for Bitcoin in the long run.

The next concluding segment of Macro Markets focuses on oil prices, as the energy commodity traded down 17.5% in three weeks.

Pechman shows how the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) doesn’t really control production and how the U.S.

government played a key role in diminishing the demand for oil imports.

According to Pechman, the biggest take for Bitcoin is the potential oil demand flatline due to weaker economic conditions, which can be deemed a short-term negative driver for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

The bank holds $40 billion in assets, although 80% of its lending portfolio has been assigned to commercial real estate loans and residential mortgages. The issue?

As usual, rising interest rates.

Meanwhile, the total underwater bond position of United States banks is $600 billion, not including derivatives.However, the U.S.

Treasury has been bailing out every one of the latest three bankruptcies: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank and First Republic.

SVB’s losses are estimated at $20 billion, or 15% of the total Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) capacity.Pechman explains how Bitcoin’s (BTC) price should react in case PacWest Bancorp fails and why gold has recently flirted with its all-time high above $2,050.

More importantly, how the banking crisis impacts government debt, which is spiraling out of control — consequently, extremely positive for Bitcoin in the long run.The next concluding segment of Macro Markets focuses on oil prices, as the energy commodity traded down 17.5% in three weeks.

Pechman shows how the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) doesn’t really control production and how the U.S.

government played a key role in diminishing the demand for oil imports.According to Pechman, the biggest take for Bitcoin is the potential oil demand flatline due to weaker economic conditions, which can be deemed a short-term negative driver for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.If you are looking for exclusive and valuable content provided by leading crypto analysts and experts, make sure to subscribe to the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

Bloomberg Intelligence’s senior macro strategist Mike McGlone is wary of crypto assets amid a worsening economic climate.

McGlone says in a new report that cryptos, outperforming other assets, could plummet if deflation sets in.

According to the Bloomberg Intelligence senior macro strategist, deflationary risks are rising.

It’s been a year of rebounds for just about everything that fell in 2022, with cryptos tops among high-beta performers, but a deflationary bust may be gaining fuel as seen in plunging commodities and bank deposits.” The Bloomberg Intelligence senior macro strategist says that crypto assets face downward risks if the broader stock market falls just like bank stocks have in the recent past.

Bitcoin, born of the 2008 financial crisis, is facing its first US recession, and if the broad stock market follows banks, cryptos are likely to ebb with the tide.” On the key levels to watch for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), McGlone says, “The up-and-coming 24/7 traded leading indicators, revolutionary technologies and assets – Bitcoin and Ethereum – may be running into a wall of resistance at the key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000.

Our bias is bullish in the long term for the top cryptos, but an overwhelming force of the stock market going down with the Fed tightening into a recession has the potential to lower the tide for all risk assets, and Bitcoin and Ethereum are among the riskiest.” Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading at $29,286 and $1,913, respectively, at time of writing.

One Looming Catalyst Could Trigger Bitcoin and Crypto Crash, Warns Bloomberg Analyst Mike McGlone by Daily Hodl Staff May 5, 2023 in Bitcoin, Ethereum Bloomberg Intelligence’s senior macro strategist Mike McGlone is wary of crypto assets amid a worsening economic climate.

McGlone says in a new report that cryptos, outperforming other assets, could plummet if deflation sets in.

According to the Bloomberg Intelligence senior macro strategist, deflationary risks are rising.

It’s been a year of rebounds for just about everything that fell in 2022, with cryptos tops among high-beta performers, but a deflationary bust may be gaining fuel as seen in plunging commodities and bank deposits.” The Bloomberg Intelligence senior macro strategist says that crypto assets face downward risks if the broader stock market falls just like bank stocks have in the recent past.

Bitcoin, born of the 2008 financial crisis, is facing its first US recession, and if the broad stock market follows banks, cryptos are likely to ebb with the tide.” On the key levels to watch for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), McGlone says, “The up-and-coming 24/7 traded leading indicators, revolutionary technologies and assets – Bitcoin and Ethereum – may be running into a wall of resistance at the key round number levels of $30,000 and $2,000.

Our bias is bullish in the long term for the top cryptos, but an overwhelming force of the stock market going down with the Fed tightening into a recession has the potential to lower the tide for all risk assets, and Bitcoin and Ethereum are among the riskiest.” Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading at $29,286 and $1,913, respectively, at time of writing.

What Does Hodl Mean?

Ether has broken out of its triangle, and that may pull the Bitcoin price above $30,000.

Confidence in the United States financial system seems to be eroding fast, with investors trying to find the next weakest link that is about to collapse.

Bill Ackman, CEO of hedge fund management firm Pershing Square, cautioned that time was running out to fix the problem.

The U.S.

equities markets have become vulnerable to adverse news on the regional banks, as seen from the sell-off in the past three days.

Compared to that, Bitcoin (BTC) has held strong and is hovering near its critical overhead resistance at $31,000.

Bitcoin is not the only outperformer.

Gold had risen close to its all-time high during the week.

This shows that Bitcoin is currently behaving as a safe-haven asset and investors are adding it to their portfolios along with gold.

Could Bitcoin overcome the barrier at $31,000 and extend the up move?

Will the altcoins follow Bitcoin higher?

Studying the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies can help answer these questions.

Bitcoin continues to trade inside the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears.

Usually, the trend that was in force before the formation of the triangle tends to resume.

That means the price is likely to break out to the upside.

If the price closes above the triangle, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to $32,400.

The bears are expected to mount a strong defense at this level because if the bulls drive the price above $32,400, the rally could reach $40,000.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that the pair may continue its random price action inside the triangle for a few more days.

A break and close below the triangle will indicate that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

The pair may then tumble to $25,250.

The bulls pushed Ether (ETH) above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 5.

This shows that the bulls absorbed the supply and have come out on top.

If buyers sustain the price above the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could first rise to $2,000 and then attempt a rally to $2,200.

The bears may aggressively defend this level because if they fail to do that, the pair may skyrocket toward $3,000.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and re-enters the triangle, it will suggest that the breakout may have been a bull trap.

The pair may then once again drop to the support line.

A break below this level may sink the pair to the target objective of $1,619.

BNB (BNB) is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern.

The flattish 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $326 and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

If the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USDT pair may continue to oscillate inside the triangle for some more time.

A break below the triangle will indicate that bears have seized control.

That is likely to start a downward move to $300 and then to the pattern target of $280.

If bulls want to gain the upper hand, they will have to propel the price above the triangle.

That will clear the path for a possible rally to $350 and then $400.

XRP (XRP) formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on May 4 and a Doji candlestick pattern on May 5.

This suggests that the bulls and the bears are playing it safe and are not waging large bets.

The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, signaling that bears have a slight edge.

The bears will try to sink the price to the strong support level at $0.43.

Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($0.47), it will indicate solid buying at lower levels.

The XRP/USDT pair may then rise to the resistance line.

Buyers will have to overcome this resistance to open up the possibility of a rally to $0.54.

Cardano (ADA) dipped below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $0.38 on May 3 and 5, but the long tail on the candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively defending the support near $0.37.

Buyers tried to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.39) on May 4, but the bears did not budge.

The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears.

If the price turns down and crumbles below $0.37, the selling could intensify and the ADA/USDT pair may descend to $0.33 and then $0.30.

If bulls want to prevent this decline, they will have to quickly propel the price above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.

That could increase the chances of a rally to $0.46 and later $0.52.

The bulls have managed to keep Dogecoin (DOGE) above the immediate support near $0.08, but they have failed to achieve a meaningful bounce off it.

This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.

A tight consolidation near a strong support level generally resolves to the downside.

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.08) and the RSI in the negative zone also indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside.

If the support near $0.08 gives way, the DOGE/USDT pair may tumble to the next major support level of $0.07.

This negative view will invalidate in the near term if buyers thrust the DOGE price above the downtrend line.

Polygon (MATIC) attempted to rise above the 20-day EMA ($1.02) on May 3 and 4, but the bears successfully protected the level.

The downsloping moving averages and the RSI near 43 suggest that the bears are in command.

If the price turns down and breaks below $0.94, the MATIC/USDT pair will complete a descending triangle pattern.

That could start a down move toward $0.69.

Instead, if the price turns up and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the lower levels continue to attract buyers.

The pair could then rally to the resistance line where the bears are again likely to sell aggressively.

Solana (SOL) has been trading in a tight range for the past three days.

This suggests a state of indecision among the buyers and sellers.

The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the SOL/USDT pair may remain stuck inside the large range between $15.28 and $27.12 for some time.

If the price slips and sustains below the 50-day SMA ($21.90), it will suggest that the bears have the upper hand in the near term.

The pair could then slide to $18.70.

On the other hand, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may start its march toward $24 and then $27.12.

Sellers yanked Polkadot (DOT) below the $5.70 support level on May 3, but the long tail shows solid buying at lower levels.

The bulls again thwarted attempts by the bears to break the support on May 4 and 5.

The repeated failure to sustain the price below $5.70 may attract buyers.

Bulls will then try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($5.96).

If they do that, the DOT/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($6.18).

Buyers will have to overcome this hurdle to gain the upper hand in the near term.

The next target on the upside is $7.

Alternatively, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears continue to sell on minor rallies.

The sellers will then again attempt to tug the price below $5.70 and challenge the crucial support at $5.15.

The long tail on Litecoin’s (LTC) May 3 and 5 candlestick shows that the bulls continue to guard the $85 level with vigor, but they are struggling to clear the overhead hurdle at the moving averages.

The LTC/USDT pair is stuck in a tight range as the bulls are buying on dips while the bears are selling on rallies.

The 20-day EMA ($89) is sloping down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a minor advantage to the bears.

A break below the $85 level will indicate that bears have taken control.

The pair may then collapse to $75.

Instead, if buyers propel the price above the moving averages, the pair could rally to the overhead resistance at $96.

If the price turns down from this level, it will point to possible range-bound action between $85 and $96 for a few days.

BTC/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingView If the price closes above the triangle, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to $32,400.

The bears are expected to mount a strong defense at this level because if the bulls drive the price above $32,400, the rally could reach $40,000.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that the pair may continue its random price action inside the triangle for a few more days.

A break and close below the triangle will indicate that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

The pair may then tumble to $25,250.

Ethereum price analysis The bulls pushed Ether (ETH) above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 5.

This shows that the bulls absorbed the supply and have come out on top.

ETH/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingView If buyers sustain the price above the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could first rise to $2,000 and then attempt a rally to $2,200.

The bears may aggressively defend this level because if they fail to do that, the pair may skyrocket toward $3,000.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and re-enters the triangle, it will suggest that the breakout may have been a bull trap.

The pair may then once again drop to the support line.

A break below this level may sink the pair to the target objective of $1,619.

BNB price analysis BNB (BNB) is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern.

BNB/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingView The flattish 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $326 and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

If the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USDT pair may continue to oscillate inside the triangle for some more time.

A break below the triangle will indicate that bears have seized control.

That is likely to start a downward move to $300 and then to the pattern target of $280.

If bulls want to gain the upper hand, they will have to propel the price above the triangle.

That will clear the path for a possible rally to $350 and then $400.

XRP price analysis XRP (XRP) formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on May 4 and a Doji candlestick pattern on May 5.

This suggests that the bulls and the bears are playing it safe and are not waging large bets.

XRP/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingView The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, signaling that bears have a slight edge.

The bears will try to sink the price to the strong support level at $0.43.

Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($0.47), it will indicate solid buying at lower levels.

The XRP/USDT pair may then rise to the resistance line.

Buyers will have to overcome this resistance to open up the possibility of a rally to $0.54.

Cardano price analysis Cardano (ADA) dipped below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $0.38 on May 3 and 5, but the long tail on the candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively defending the support near $0.37.

ADA/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingView Buyers tried to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.39) on May 4, but the bears did not budge.

The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears.

If the price turns down and crumbles below $0.37, the selling could intensify and the ADA/USDT pair may descend to $0.33 and then $0.30.

If bulls want to prevent this decline, they will have to quickly propel the price above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.

That could increase the chances of a rally to $0.46 and later $0.52.

Dogecoin price analysis The bulls have managed to keep Dogecoin (DOGE) above the immediate support near $0.08, but they have failed to achieve a meaningful bounce off it.

This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.

DOGE/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingView A tight consolidation near a strong support level generally resolves to the downside.

The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.08) and the RSI in the negative zone also indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside.

If the support near $0.08 gives way, the DOGE/USDT pair may tumble to the next major support level of $0.07.

This negative view will invalidate in the near term if buyers thrust the DOGE price above the downtrend line.

Polygon price analysis Polygon (MATIC) attempted to rise above the 20-day EMA ($1.02) on May 3 and 4, but the bears successfully protected the level.

MATIC/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingView The downsloping moving averages and the RSI near 43 suggest that the bears are in command.

If the price turns down and breaks below $0.94, the MATIC/USDT pair will complete a descending triangle pattern.

That could start a down move toward $0.69.

Instead, if the price turns up and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the lower levels continue to attract buyers.

The pair could then rally to the resistance line where the bears are again likely to sell aggressively.

Related: SUI price drops 70% from market debut top amid excessive supply concerns Solana price analysis Solana (SOL) has been trading in a tight range for the past three days.

This suggests a state of indecision among the buyers and sellers.

SOL/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingView The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the SOL/USDT pair may remain stuck inside the large range between $15.28 and $27.12 for some time.

If the price slips and sustains below the 50-day SMA ($21.90), it will suggest that the bears have the upper hand in the near term.

The pair could then slide to $18.70.

On the other hand, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may start its march toward $24 and then $27.12.

Polkadot price analysis Sellers yanked Polkadot (DOT) below the $5.70 support level on May 3, but the long tail shows solid buying at lower levels.

The bulls again thwarted attempts by the bears to break the support on May 4 and 5.

DOT/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingView The repeated failure to sustain the price below $5.70 may attract buyers.

Bulls will then try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($5.96).

If they do that, the DOT/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($6.18).

Buyers will have to overcome this hurdle to gain the upper hand in the near term.

The next target on the upside is $7.

Alternatively, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears continue to sell on minor rallies.

The sellers will then again attempt to tug the price below $5.70 and challenge the crucial support at $5.15.

Litecoin price analysis The long tail on Litecoin’s (LTC) May 3 and 5 candlestick shows that the bulls continue to guard the $85 level with vigor, but they are struggling to clear the overhead hurdle at the moving averages.

LTC/USDT daily chart.

Source: TradingView The LTC/USDT pair is stuck in a tight range as the bulls are buying on dips while the bears are selling on rallies.

The 20-day EMA ($89) is sloping down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a minor advantage to the bears.

A break below the $85 level will indicate that bears have taken control.

The pair may then collapse to $75.

Instead, if buyers propel the price above the moving averages, the pair could rally to the overhead resistance at $96.

If the price turns down from this level, it will point to possible range-bound action between $85 and $96 for a few days.

2023 can be a game changer for both Stellar and Ripple, and the upcoming updates can have notable impacts.

ChatGPT also showed confidence in both XLM and XRP.

As the world is looking forward to a sustainable future, many in the crypto space are skeptical about mining.

Thinking of non-minable cryptos, apart from Ethereum [ETH], which recently adopted PoS, Ripple [XRP] and Stellar [XLM] are two other major players.

Therefore, Stellar vs Ripple is an intriguing topic of discussion that can help investors make informed decisions.

Though both blockchains share a few similarities, there are several key areas in which they differ.

First and foremost, Stellar is an open-source platform, which is not the case with Ripple.

It’s interesting that while both blockchains were developed to create an impact on financial services, their ideologies are poles apart.

On one hand, XRP’s focus remains primarily on banks, while Stellar’s purpose is to give consumers a chance to engage with the global market.

Another major difference is in the nature of their native tokens, as XRP is a deflationary token and XLM has a fixed annual inflation rate.

Mentioning both the cryptos’ tokenomics, CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that XRP at press time had a circulating supply of 51.8 billion tokens, while Stellar’s native token XLM had 26.7 billion.

XRP and XLM have a maximum supply of 100 billion and 50 billion, respectively.

It was interesting to note that at the time of writing, both tokens had a circulating supply of just above 50% of their total supply.

Not to mention, XRP has a higher market capitalization of more than $23.9 billion, earning it the sixth spot on the list of largest cryptos.

On the contrary, XLM sits in the 28th spot on the same list with a market cap of over $2.4 billion.

A major setback for Ripple has been its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been troubling XRP since 2020.

For starters, the SEC accused Ripple and its employees, Christian Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, of selling unregulated securities worth more than $1.3 billion to the public.

The lawsuit certainly had a negative impact on XRP, as investors might have gotten dubious about the token.

However, the good news is that the lawsuit is expected to end soon, as many had anticipated.

Hoping Judge Torres rules any day now or a settlement is announced, but in the meantime i have set myself imagined timelines for the case to end.

From my list in March only 2 remain.

I have removed May 29th as that is Memorial day.

While XRP’s lawsuit closure will be instrumental for the blockchain’s growth, Stellar’s plans for 2023 are also optimistic.

The blockchain’s primary focus for 2023 is to increase its utility.

As per Stellar’s roadmap, its work this year will be organized around three building blocks that take network utility to the next level.

Choosing which smart contracts platform to build on can be difficult.

So let us make it easier for you.

One of the major updates was the launch of a new, state-of-the-art smart contract platform that is developer-friendly, scalable, and deeply integrated with Stellar, named Soroban.

As of 5 May, Soroban was live on the test network dubbed Futurenet.

In comparison to the previous quarter, Ripple’s total XRP sales, net of purchases, were $361.06 million in Q1, as compared to $226.31 million in the previous quarter.

On the price front, things remained dormant for most days in Q1.

It was only in late March that XRP’s price shot up.

The price also made XRP more popular, as evident from the rise in its social volume.

During the price hike, XRP’s network growth also increased, indicating more new addresses were used to transfer the token.

XLM’s situation was also similar to that of XRP’s in the first quarter of 2023.

The token’s one-week price volatility remained low, which later spiked when the token’s price registered gains.

Thanks to the price uptick, XLM’s social volume also increased during the last few weeks of the quarter.

The quarter started on a good note for both tokens, as their prices were high.

However, it did not take long for things to get darker, thanks to the bearish market condition.

Stellar’s development activity has increased over the last few weeks, which is by and large a positive signal.

However, its volume and weighted sentiment declined sharply, reflecting less interest from investors in XLM.

On the contrary, XRP’s development activity declined, suggesting fewer efforts by the developers to improve the network.

The price drop propelled negative sentiments in the market, as evidenced from the weighted sentiment graph.

Investors’ willingness to trade XRP was, however, higher than XLM, as XRP’s trading volume was relatively higher.

At press time, XRP was trading at $0.463, while XLM was valued at $0.09332.

Jailbroken ChatGPT had an interesting opinion on both blockchains’ comparisons.

The DAN was quick to highlight a few differences between Stellar and Ripple.

Then it said that, in terms of investment purposes, investors can put their bets on both of the tokens.

Considering the aforementioned points, 2023 will be an instrumental year for both blockchains.

One has a robust roadmap, while the other’s fate might change with its possible lawsuit conclusion.

Which way Stellar and Ripple head over the coming months will be interesting to monitor.

Here’s why you should build on Soroban over other popular platforms like Ethereum & Solana 👇https://t.co/A2NVQVtIP5 — Stellar (@StellarOrg) April 25, 2023 One of the major updates was the launch of a new, state-of-the-art smart contract platform that is developer-friendly, scalable, and deeply integrated with Stellar, named Soroban.

As of 5 May, Soroban was live on the test network dubbed Futurenet.

XRP and XLM in Q1 2023 In comparison to the previous quarter, Ripple’s total XRP sales, net of purchases, were $361.06 million in Q1, as compared to $226.31 million in the previous quarter.

On the price front, things remained dormant for most days in Q1.

It was only in late March that XRP’s price shot up.

The price also made XRP more popular, as evident from the rise in its social volume.

During the price hike, XRP’s network growth also increased, indicating more new addresses were used to transfer the token.

The token’s one-week price volatility remained low, which later spiked when the token’s price registered gains.

Thanks to the price uptick, XLM’s social volume also increased during the last few weeks of the quarter.

Source: Santiment Stellar vs Ripple in Q2 The quarter started on a good note for both tokens, as their prices were high.

However, it did not take long for things to get darker, thanks to the bearish market condition.

Stellar’s development activity has increased over the last few weeks, which is by and large a positive signal.

However, its volume and weighted sentiment declined sharply, reflecting less interest from investors in XLM.

Source: Santiment On the contrary, XRP’s development activity declined, suggesting fewer efforts by the developers to improve the network.

The price drop propelled negative sentiments in the market, as evidenced from the weighted sentiment graph.

Investors’ willingness to trade XRP was, however, higher than XLM, as XRP’s trading volume was relatively higher.

At press time, XRP was trading at $0.463, while XLM was valued at $0.09332.

ChatGPT’s take on Stellar vs.

Ripple Jailbroken ChatGPT had an interesting opinion on both blockchains’ comparisons.

The DAN was quick to highlight a few differences between Stellar and Ripple.

Then it said that, in terms of investment purposes, investors can put their bets on both of the tokens.

Or not, if you want to “wallow.” Source: ChatGPT Considering the aforementioned points, 2023 will be an instrumental year for both blockchains.

One has a robust roadmap, while the other’s fate might change with its possible lawsuit conclusion.

Which way Stellar and Ripple head over the coming months will be interesting to monitor.

5min Read 2023 can be a game changer for both Stellar and Ripple, and the upcoming updates can have notable impacts.

ChatGPT also showed confidence in both XLM and XRP.

May 5, 2023 Dipayan Mitra Journalist Dipayan Mitra Journalist May 5, 2023 Share this article Share Tweet Though Stellar and Ripple were designed for cross-border payments and digital asset exchanges, they have several differences.

Q2 for both tokens has been challenging, thanks to bearish market conditions.

As the world is looking forward to a sustainable future, many in the crypto space are skeptical about mining.

Thinking of non-minable cryptos, apart from Ethereum [ETH], which recently adopted PoS, Ripple [XRP] and Stellar [XLM] are two other major players.

Therefore, Stellar vs Ripple is an intriguing topic of discussion that can help investors make informed decisions.

Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2023-24 The basic difference between Stellar and Ripple Though both blockchains share a few similarities, there are several key areas in which they differ.

First and foremost, Stellar is an open-source platform, which is not the case with Ripple.

It’s interesting that while both blockchains were developed to create an impact on financial services, their ideologies are poles apart.

On one hand, XRP’s focus remains primarily on banks, while Stellar’s purpose is to give consumers a chance to engage with the global market.

Another major difference is in the nature of their native tokens, as XRP is a deflationary token and XLM has a fixed annual inflation rate.

A look at XLM and XRP’s tokenomics Mentioning both the cryptos’ tokenomics, CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that XRP at press time had a circulating supply of 51.8 billion tokens, while Stellar’s native token XLM had 26.7 billion.

XRP and XLM have a maximum supply of 100 billion and 50 billion, respectively.

It was interesting to note that at the time of writing, both tokens had a circulating supply of just above 50% of their total supply.

Not to mention, XRP has a higher market capitalization of more than $23.9 billion, earning it the sixth spot on the list of largest cryptos.

On the contrary, XLM sits in the 28th spot on the same list with a market cap of over $2.4 billion.

XRP is yet to unleash its full might A major setback for Ripple has been its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been troubling XRP since 2020.

For starters, the SEC accused Ripple and its employees, Christian Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, of selling unregulated securities worth more than $1.3 billion to the public.

The lawsuit certainly had a negative impact on XRP, as investors might have gotten dubious about the token.

However, the good news is that the lawsuit is expected to end soon, as many had anticipated.

XRP #XRPCommunityHoping Judge Torres rules any day now or a settlement is announced, but in the meantime i have set myself imagined timelines for the case to end.

From my list in March only 2 remain.

I have removed May 29th as that is Memorial day.

So June 5th and June 21st…… https://t.co/UUrjf3lcKS — Ashley PROSPER (@AshleyPROSPER1) May 1, 2023 Stellar’s plans for 2023 looks promising While XRP’s lawsuit closure will be instrumental for the blockchain’s growth, Stellar’s plans for 2023 are also optimistic.

The blockchain’s primary focus for 2023 is to increase its utility.

As per Stellar’s roadmap, its work this year will be organized around three building blocks that take network utility to the next level.

Altcoin Stellar vs Ripple: Which way should investors lean in 2023?

5min Read 2023 can be a game changer for both Stellar and Ripple, and the upcoming updates can have notable impacts.

ChatGPT also showed confidence in both XLM and XRP.

May 5, 2023 Dipayan Mitra Journalist Dipayan Mitra Journalist May 5, 2023 Share this article Share Tweet Though Stellar and Ripple were designed for cross-border payments and digital asset exchanges, they have several differences.

Q2 for both tokens has been challenging, thanks to bearish market conditions.

As the world is looking forward to a sustainable future, many in the crypto space are skeptical about mining.

Thinking of non-minable cryptos, apart from Ethereum [ETH], which recently adopted PoS, Ripple [XRP] and Stellar [XLM] are two other major players.

Therefore, Stellar vs Ripple is an intriguing topic of discussion that can help investors make informed decisions.

Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2023-24 The basic difference between Stellar and Ripple Though both blockchains share a few similarities, there are several key areas in which they differ.

First and foremost, Stellar is an open-source platform, which is not the case with Ripple.

It’s interesting that while both blockchains were developed to create an impact on financial services, their ideologies are poles apart.

On one hand, XRP’s focus remains primarily on banks, while Stellar’s purpose is to give consumers a chance to engage with the global market.

Another major difference is in the nature of their native tokens, as XRP is a deflationary token and XLM has a fixed annual inflation rate.

A look at XLM and XRP’s tokenomics Mentioning both the cryptos’ tokenomics, CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that XRP at press time had a circulating supply of 51.8 billion tokens, while Stellar’s native token XLM had 26.7 billion.

XRP and XLM have a maximum supply of 100 billion and 50 billion, respectively.

It was interesting to note that at the time of writing, both tokens had a circulating supply of just above 50% of their total supply.

Not to mention, XRP has a higher market capitalization of more than $23.9 billion, earning it the sixth spot on the list of largest cryptos.

On the contrary, XLM sits in the 28th spot on the same list with a market cap of over $2.4 billion.

XRP is yet to unleash its full might A major setback for Ripple has been its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been troubling XRP since 2020.

For starters, the SEC accused Ripple and its employees, Christian Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, of selling unregulated securities worth more than $1.3 billion to the public.

The lawsuit certainly had a negative impact on XRP, as investors might have gotten dubious about the token.

However, the good news is that the lawsuit is expected to end soon, as many had anticipated.

XRP #XRPCommunityHoping Judge Torres rules any day now or a settlement is announced, but in the meantime i have set myself imagined timelines for the case to end.

From my list in March only 2 remain.

I have removed May 29th as that is Memorial day.

So June 5th and June 21st…… https://t.co/UUrjf3lcKS — Ashley PROSPER (@AshleyPROSPER1) May 1, 2023 Stellar’s plans for 2023 looks promising While XRP’s lawsuit closure will be instrumental for the blockchain’s growth, Stellar’s plans for 2023 are also optimistic.

The blockchain’s primary focus for 2023 is to increase its utility.

As per Stellar’s roadmap, its work this year will be organized around three building blocks that take network utility to the next level.

Choosing which smart contracts platform to build on can be difficult.

So let us make it easier for you.

Here’s why you should build on Soroban over other popular platforms like Ethereum & Solana 👇https://t.co/A2NVQVtIP5 — Stellar (@StellarOrg) April 25, 2023 One of the major updates was the launch of a new, state-of-the-art smart contract platform that is developer-friendly, scalable, and deeply integrated with Stellar, named Soroban.

As of 5 May, Soroban was live on the test network dubbed Futurenet.

XRP and XLM in Q1 2023 In comparison to the previous quarter, Ripple’s total XRP sales, net of purchases, were $361.06 million in Q1, as compared to $226.31 million in the previous quarter.

On the price front, things remained dormant for most days in Q1.

It was only in late March that XRP’s price shot up.

The price also made XRP more popular, as evident from the rise in its social volume.

During the price hike, XRP’s network growth also increased, indicating more new addresses were used to transfer the token.

Source: Santiment XLM’s situation was also similar to that of XRP’s in the first quarter of 2023.

The token’s one-week price volatility remained low, which later spiked when the token’s price registered gains.

Thanks to the price uptick, XLM’s social volume also increased during the last few weeks of the quarter.

Source: Santiment Stellar vs Ripple in Q2 The quarter started on a good note for both tokens, as their prices were high.

However, it did not take long for things to get darker, thanks to the bearish market condition.

Stellar’s development activity has increased over the last few weeks, which is by and large a positive signal.

However, its volume and weighted sentiment declined sharply, reflecting less interest from investors in XLM.

Source: Santiment On the contrary, XRP’s development activity declined, suggesting fewer efforts by the developers to improve the network.

The price drop propelled negative sentiments in the market, as evidenced from the weighted sentiment graph.

Investors’ willingness to trade XRP was, however, higher than XLM, as XRP’s trading volume was relatively higher.

At press time, XRP was trading at $0.463, while XLM was valued at $0.09332.

More Articles XRP Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025-2030: XRP scores at this level, more inside By Suzuki Shillsalot 8 hours ago Altcoin Stellar (XLM) Price Prediction 2025-30: Are XLM’s fortunes finally turning?

Though Stellar and Ripple were designed for cross-border payments and digital asset exchanges, they have several differences.

Q2 for both tokens has been challenging, thanks to bearish market conditions.

As the world is looking forward to a sustainable future, many in the crypto space are skeptical about mining.

Thinking of non-minable cryptos, apart from Ethereum [ETH], which recently adopted PoS, Ripple [XRP] and Stellar [XLM] are two other major players.

Therefore, Stellar vs Ripple is an intriguing topic of discussion that can help investors make informed decisions.

Read Ripple’s [XRP] Price Prediction 2023-24 The basic difference between Stellar and Ripple Though both blockchains share a few similarities, there are several key areas in which they differ.

First and foremost, Stellar is an open-source platform, which is not the case with Ripple.

It’s interesting that while both blockchains were developed to create an impact on financial services, their ideologies are poles apart.

On one hand, XRP’s focus remains primarily on banks, while Stellar’s purpose is to give consumers a chance to engage with the global market.

Another major difference is in the nature of their native tokens, as XRP is a deflationary token and XLM has a fixed annual inflation rate.

A look at XLM and XRP’s tokenomics Mentioning both the cryptos’ tokenomics, CoinMarketCap’s data revealed that XRP at press time had a circulating supply of 51.8 billion tokens, while Stellar’s native token XLM had 26.7 billion.

XRP and XLM have a maximum supply of 100 billion and 50 billion, respectively.

It was interesting to note that at the time of writing, both tokens had a circulating supply of just above 50% of their total supply.

Not to mention, XRP has a higher market capitalization of more than $23.9 billion, earning it the sixth spot on the list of largest cryptos.

On the contrary, XLM sits in the 28th spot on the same list with a market cap of over $2.4 billion.

XRP is yet to unleash its full might A major setback for Ripple has been its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has been troubling XRP since 2020.

For starters, the SEC accused Ripple and its employees, Christian Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse, of selling unregulated securities worth more than $1.3 billion to the public.

The lawsuit certainly had a negative impact on XRP, as investors might have gotten dubious about the token.

However, the good news is that the lawsuit is expected to end soon, as many had anticipated.

XRP #XRPCommunityHoping Judge Torres rules any day now or a settlement is announced, but in the meantime i have set myself imagined timelines for the case to end.

From my list in March only 2 remain.

I have removed May 29th as that is Memorial day.

So June 5th and June 21st…… https://t.co/UUrjf3lcKS — Ashley PROSPER (@AshleyPROSPER1) May 1, 2023 Stellar’s plans for 2023 looks promising While XRP’s lawsuit closure will be instrumental for the blockchain’s growth, Stellar’s plans for 2023 are also optimistic.

The blockchain’s primary focus for 2023 is to increase its utility.

As per Stellar’s roadmap, its work this year will be organized around three building blocks that take network utility to the next level.

Choosing which smart contracts platform to build on can be difficult.

So let us make it easier for you.

Here’s why you should build on Soroban over other popular platforms like Ethereum & Solana 👇https://t.co/A2NVQVtIP5 — Stellar (@StellarOrg) April 25, 2023 One of the major updates was the launch of a new, state-of-the-art smart contract platform that is developer-friendly, scalable, and deeply integrated with Stellar, named Soroban.

As of 5 May, Soroban was live on the test network dubbed Futurenet.

XRP and XLM in Q1 2023 In comparison to the previous quarter, Ripple’s total XRP sales, net of purchases, were $361.06 million in Q1, as compared to $226.31 million in the previous quarter.

On the price front, things remained dormant for most days in Q1.

It was only in late March that XRP’s price shot up.

The price also made XRP more popular, as evident from the rise in its social volume.

During the price hike, XRP’s network growth also increased, indicating more new addresses were used to transfer the token.

Source: Santiment XLM’s situation was also similar to that of XRP’s in the first quarter of 2023.

The token’s one-week price volatility remained low, which later spiked when the token’s price registered gains.

Thanks to the price uptick, XLM’s social volume also increased during the last few weeks of the quarter.

Source: Santiment Stellar vs Ripple in Q2 The quarter started on a good note for both tokens, as their prices were high.

However, it did not take long for things to get darker, thanks to the bearish market condition.

Stellar’s development activity has increased over the last few weeks, which is by and large a positive signal.

However, its volume and weighted sentiment declined sharply, reflecting less interest from investors in XLM.

Source: Santiment On the contrary, XRP’s development activity declined, suggesting fewer efforts by the developers to improve the network.

The price drop propelled negative sentiments in the market, as evidenced from the weighted sentiment graph.

Investors’ willingness to trade XRP was, however, higher than XLM, as XRP’s trading volume was relatively higher.

At press time, XRP was trading at $0.463, while XLM was valued at $0.09332.

ChatGPT’s take on Stellar vs.

Ripple Jailbroken ChatGPT had an interesting opinion on both blockchains’ comparisons.

The DAN was quick to highlight a few differences between Stellar and Ripple.

Then it said that, in terms of investment purposes, investors can put their bets on both of the tokens.

Or not, if you want to “wallow.” Source: ChatGPT Considering the aforementioned points, 2023 will be an instrumental year for both blockchains.

One has a robust roadmap, while the other’s fate might change with its possible lawsuit conclusion.

Which way Stellar and Ripple head over the coming months will be interesting to monitor.

In a stunning turn of events, an early investor going by the alias dimethyltryptamine.eth has seen his modest investment of $260 in the meme-based cryptocurrency Pepe ($PEPE) balloon to nearly $8 million, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham.

The Pepe meme coin has seen a massive price increase.

Today, it has so far added another 125.3%, according to recent CoinGecko data.

Now ranking 40th in market capitalization at an impressive $1.57 billion, $PEPE's surge has defied early skepticism of its potential as another meme-based cryptocurrency.

With a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1.16 billion, it's clear that $PEPE is gaining serious traction among investors.

The May 5 listings of PEPE on high-profile exchanges like Binance and Crypto.com are significant milestones, lending increased legitimacy to the coin and opening it up to a wider pool of potential investors.

His tenacious hold on his PEPE tokens, in spite of the significant price increase, highlights a prevalent trend of long-term holding strategies among cryptocurrency investors.

However, considering the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, it remains uncertain whether PEPE can sustain its upward trajectory.

The May 5 listings of PEPE on high-profile exchanges like Binance and Crypto.com are significant milestones, lending increased legitimacy to the coin and opening it up to a wider pool of potential investors.

His tenacious hold on his PEPE tokens, in spite of the significant price increase, highlights a prevalent trend of long-term holding strategies among cryptocurrency investors.

However, considering the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, it remains uncertain whether PEPE can sustain its upward trajectory.

Cryptocurrency mogul Do Kwon, infamous for his involvement in the Terra Luna coin fiasco, might be facing up to 40 years in jail, per a recent report by The Wall Street Journal.

Dan Sung-han, the South Korean prosecutor overseeing the case, suggests that Kwon's extradition to South Korea would be the best way to serve justice to investors who were hurt by the $40 billion implosion of the TerraUSD cryptocurrency.

Kwon, who co-founded Terraform Labs and was the mastermind behind the now-collapsed TerraUSD and Luna digital currencies, has been under arrest in Montenegro.

Both South Korean and U.S.

prosecutors are currently vying for his extradition.

Sung-han maintains that South Korea is more capable of handling the case as most of the evidence and significant accomplices linked to Terraform Labs are located there.

Last July, the Korean Supreme Court upheld the 40-year prison sentence for Jae-hyun in one of the country's largest fund fraud schemes that involved over $1.08 billion in investments.

As reported by U.Today, Kwon's arrest in Montenegro was confirmed by South Korean officials in March.

Shortly after that, some damning footage showing Kwon and Terraform CFO Han Chang-joon being escorted out of a Montenegrin court in handcuffs emerged on social media.

Twitter crypto analyst @lookonchain has been making waves in the cryptocurrency world, thanks to his ability to spot early meme coin investments that have skyrocketed in value.

His latest find, Pepe, has been making headlines recently as it continues its incredible run.

Back in January 2021, Lookonchain invested $96,500 in Shiba Inu and made a profit of $1.18 million, with unrealized gains on the SHIB coins he still holds.

He then invested $36,000 in Pepe and $61,000 in Wojak, which have since increased in value to $95,000 and $329,000, respectively.

Pepe, in particular, has seen an explosion in price, with a 25,000% increase in the past two weeks alone.

The token has also experienced a 1,000% increase since being listed on centralized exchanges, up 80% today.

Bybit short positions are also about to pay 0.75% funding to longs heading into the Friday daily open.

While Pepe’s market cap currently stands at $820 million, there is speculation that it could break out above the $1 billion level.

If it does, it would become the largest meme crypto on the charts, with only SHIB and Dogecoin standing in its way.

Meme coins are often considered high risk assets, but they can also be highly rewarding.

Lookonchain’s success with Pepe and other meme coins shows the potential for huge profits in this market.

However, it’s worth noting that meme coins are volatile and should be approached with caution.

Altcoin season is currently well underway for meme coins, with other assets with amusing names and little utility currently outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto markets.

Other meme coins, such as PC, WSB, BOB, BOG, HEX, DINO, PPIZZA, REDDIT, and MONG, have been vying for position on the DEXTools trending crypto list.

Despite the hype surrounding meme coins, it’s important to remember that they are still a relatively new and untested asset class.

As always, it’s crucial to do your own research and invest wisely.

In conclusion, Lookonchain’s success with meme coins is a testament to the potential for high returns in this market.

Pepe’s recent performance shows the potential for continued growth, but investors should approach with caution due to the volatility of these assets.

As always, it’s important to do your own research and invest wisely.

Blockchain News Twitter Crypto Analyst Makes Millions with Meme Coins – What’s Next for Pepe?

May 5, 2023 1 minute read 10 hours ago share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Whatsapp Share via Email Twitter crypto analyst @lookonchain has been making waves in the cryptocurrency world, thanks to his ability to spot early meme coin investments that have skyrocketed in value.

His latest find, Pepe, has been making headlines recently as it continues its incredible run.

Back in January 2021, Lookonchain invested $96,500 in Shiba Inu and made a profit of $1.18 million, with unrealized gains on the SHIB coins he still holds.

He then invested $36,000 in Pepe and $61,000 in Wojak, which have since increased in value to $95,000 and $329,000, respectively.

Pepe, in particular, has seen an explosion in price, with a 25,000% increase in the past two weeks alone.

The token has also experienced a 1,000% increase since being listed on centralized exchanges, up 80% today.

Bybit short positions are also about to pay 0.75% funding to longs heading into the Friday daily open.

While Pepe’s market cap currently stands at $820 million, there is speculation that it could break out above the $1 billion level.

If it does, it would become the largest meme crypto on the charts, with only SHIB and Dogecoin standing in its way.

Meme coins are often considered high risk assets, but they can also be highly rewarding.

Lookonchain’s success with Pepe and other meme coins shows the potential for huge profits in this market.

However, it’s worth noting that meme coins are volatile and should be approached with caution.

Altcoin season is currently well underway for meme coins, with other assets with amusing names and little utility currently outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto markets.

Other meme coins, such as PC, WSB, BOB, BOG, HEX, DINO, PPIZZA, REDDIT, and MONG, have been vying for position on the DEXTools trending crypto list.

Despite the hype surrounding meme coins, it’s important to remember that they are still a relatively new and untested asset class.

As always, it’s crucial to do your own research and invest wisely.

Emi Yoshikawa, Ripple's VP of strategy and operations, has shared more details on the decentralized ID (XLS-40d) proposal that recently went live.

Earlier, the research team released a spec for native support of decentralized identity (XLS-40d) for community review.

According to Yoshikawa, the decentralized ID (XLS-40d) currently proposed to the XRPL community is DID as a native feature of the protocol layer, compliant with the W3C DID standard.

The World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) standardized Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) enable verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities and are designed to be compatible with any distributed ledger or network.

For that reason, Yoshikawa says DID is standardized, so it seems that it will play an active role as an enabling technology that supports various use cases (DeFi, tokenization) of XRPL in the future.

The XLS-40d proposal aims to define a DID format for XRP Ledger that confirms with W3C DID standards that can be created, owned and controlled by any XRPL account holder.

It would also define DID implementation methods that can be used by any service, wallet or application, as it aims to leverage existing (and emerging) decentralized identity standards proposed by the W3C.

On Feb.

22, Ripple developers put forth a new interoperability standard (XLS-38d) that will allow for a cross-chain bridge to enable interoperability between various blockchain networks.

Regardless of the underlying protocols or programming languages used by different blockchains, the proposed standard will allow users to transfer digital assets and data between them.

This would expand the use cases and adoption of XRP Ledger by enabling tokens from one blockchain to be locked in an account on XRP Ledger while an equivalent number of tokens are issued on another blockchain.

Over one million assets have been minted on the ledger since XLS-20 went live on the mainnet.

Meanwhile, sidechains and the automated market maker (AMM) amendment are coming to a close and will soon undergo third-party security reviews.

Regardless of the underlying protocols or programming languages used by different blockchains, the proposed standard will allow users to transfer digital assets and data between them.

Over one million assets have been minted on the ledger since XLS-20 went live on the mainnet.

Meanwhile, sidechains and the automated market maker (AMM) amendment are coming to a close and will soon undergo third-party security reviews.

Earlier, the research team released a spec for native support of decentralized identity (XLS-40d) for community review.

According to Yoshikawa, the decentralized ID (XLS-40d) currently proposed to the XRPL community is DID as a native feature of the protocol layer, compliant with the W3C DID standard.

XRPLコミュニティに提案されている分散型ID(xls-40d)は、W3CのDID規格に準拠した、プロトコルレイヤーのネイティブ機能としてのDID。 その為、安全かつ標準化されたDIDなので、今後XRPLの様々なユースケース(DeFi、tokenization)を支えるenabling techとして活躍してくれそうです。… — Emi Yoshikawa (@emy_wng) May 5, 2023 The World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) standardized Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) enable verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities and are designed to be compatible with any distributed ledger or network.

For that reason, Yoshikawa says DID is standardized, so it seems that it will play an active role as an enabling technology that supports various use cases (DeFi, tokenization) of XRPL in the future.

The XLS-40d proposal aims to define a DID format for XRP Ledger that confirms with W3C DID standards that can be created, owned and controlled by any XRPL account holder.

It would also define DID implementation methods that can be used by any service, wallet or application, as it aims to leverage existing (and emerging) decentralized identity standards proposed by the W3C.
